<h1>A Closeted Tourist</h1>

<p>Shadimon is a lead from the front kind of military leader. He believes that there should be no duty that is beneath even the highest level of leadership. It inspires his soldiers to take pride in their work and improves morale. Shadimon reminds himself several times that this is why he's on another night patrol. The sun has just now set on Asavardi, but someone has to keep watch. Tonight, it's him.</p>
<p>As he was wrapping up a flight over some of the newly created homes in the cliffside, a young elf takes flight from the walkway and approaches him. Radiven, he remembers. One of the long range messengers. Radiven flags him down and they both land on the walkway outside the young elf's home.</p>
<p>"Uh, hi Shadimon," Radiven clears his throat, "I think there's someone in my pantry. I heard something rooting around in there. Maybe an animal? Could you check it out for me please?"</p>
<p>Shadimon sighs, "Sure."</p>
<p>Shadimon enters the home to check on the weird noises while Radiven waits outside. The cliffside house is dark, with only moonlight filtering in through the shuttered windows. Sure enough, Shadimon can hear the sound of clattering and rummaging from the pantry. He moves quietly through the living room.</p>
<p><i>Probably just some teenagers, he thinks, maybe another curious dreamdust elf. Either that or there's a bird trapped in there.</i></p>
<p>Shadimon approaches the back room and knocks on the storage room door. Better to announce himself. The noise stops.</p>
<p>From around the storage room door walks the fully hybrid form Tourist, her ears nearly touching the ceiling. She turns her eyes down to Shadimon's solidly two feet shorter frame and says, “Well?”</p>
<p>Shadimon takes several seconds to process what he is seeing. Her posture is not aggressive. Her sword is not drawn.  It is still strapped to her back.</p>
<p>The shock is legitimate.</p>
<p>"Moment, please," Shadimon holds up a finger to the Tourist and steps outside.</p>
<p>"Well?" Radiven asks, "Was there someone there?"</p>
<p>"Radiven?" Shadimon speaks in a very carefully metered tone, "Please go somewhere else for a little while."</p>
<p>A bit perplexed, the messenger takes off towards the center of the town. Shadimon closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, then steps back inside.</p>
<p>The Tourist is leaning casually against the doorframe to the pantry, her arms folded. She raises an eyebrow as Shadimon marches towards her with fluffed up wings.</p>
<p>“How in the hell?” Shadimon gestures at the cliff outside emphatically.</p>
<p>“Oh, those decorative trees you carved were excellent handholds actually.”</p>
<p>Another couple of seconds of silence.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Were you honestly expecting me to answer that or was it rhetorical?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Why?”</p>
<p>“I’m not telling you," the Tourist snorts and speaks with mock fear,  "Oh dear you’ve caught me, let me confess all my secrets.  We’re not quite at that point yet.”</p>
<p>Shadimon takes a steadying breath, "According to the river elves you were really quite talkative.”</p>
<p>“Well, we’re talking," She shrugs,  "Speaking of which, you didn’t call for more guards, did you?”</p>
<p>“No, I asked the person whose house this is to go elsewhere.  I’m the only person who knows you’re here.”</p>
<p>“That’s smart.  Because otherwise we would have a problem.” Her voice is cold.</p>
<p>“And that’s the last thing I want," Shadimon meets her eyes, "What I’m really interested in is are you intending on hurting anyone or doing any damage?”</p>
<p>“No.” She answers bluntly.</p>
<p>“Right, so we have minimal problems.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Well I’ve already finished what I came here to do, so if you want to just make small talk I can oblige. How’s the weather up here?”</p>
<p>Shadimon let that sarcastic comment slide. He processed for a moment. He knew that the protective ward had not been tripped. It would have taken time for her to climb this high. If she was intending to hurt anyone, the ward would have been tripped long ago. She was telling the truth.</p>
<p>“What are you looking for that you’re expecting to find in a random person’s closet?” Shadimon asked.</p>
<p>“I already found what I was looking for, and I’m not telling you.  You’ll have to try harder than that.”</p>
<p>Shadimon takes a closer look at the open door behind her. In the dim light, he realizes that she had been digging through the pantry's spice rack. Several jars are missing.</p>
<p>Shadimon sits on a nearby chair and considers the life choices that brought him here. He is baffled that this is not how Werewolves act.  Why the fuck.</p>
<p>“Alright. Whatever. I don’t care why you’re here.  I would like you to not be here.”</p>
<p>“Well I can work with that.  Are you going to have your guards shoot me on the way down?”</p>
<p>“No.  We don’t want any trouble.”</p>
<p>“Good.  I don’t want that either." </p>
<p>Shadimon turns back to her, "Look, if you come back.  Instead of stealing from people.  Just leave a message and ask for something.”</p>
<p>“With who?  Will you leave a box at the front that says werewolf on it or something?”</p>
<p>“That’s actually a good question.  It hasn’t come up before.”</p>
<p>As Shadimon sits there, the Tourist cocks her head at him.</p>
<p>“Hm. Perhaps I’m being rude,” she speaks in a more level tone before shifting into her elven form. Still a solid foot taller than Shadimon, but considerably less alarming. She casually takes a seat across from him, watching him quietly.</p>
<p>“I have so many questions," Shadimon grumbles, "And there is not a single one of them that you’re going to be inclined to answer.”</p>
<p>“Well I don’t want to get shot climbing down a cliff face," she shrugs casually, "So I am willing to be civil. Feel free to make an attempt."</p>
<p>Shadimon speaks calmly to her, "At this point, unless I start screaming bloody murder no one’s going to be aiming to shoot you. People are watching this cave; I’m sure of that.  But if I leave here alive no one is going to shoot you.  Everyone here knows who you are.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware of that.”</p>
<p>“I’m assuming that’s why you haven’t tried to attack me yet.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I just like you.” She smirks.</p>
<p>Shadimon snorts,  “That’s worse.” He sighed heavily and muttered,  “The fire elves are never finding out about this. I do not want to hear it.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, you’ve been very polite.  All things considered.”</p>
<p>“Of all things I was expecting today, a werewolf in a closet was not on the list anywhere.  And while we’re being honest, this would not be a fight.” He gestures at himself and back to her.  “Why the sword?  Why a silver sword?”</p>
<p>“Well I can’t tell you everything about that," Her voice is cold and quiet, "but I can tell you that everything has a purpose.  Including silver, under the right circumstances.”</p>
<p>“I suppose there have probably been outbreaks lately.”</p>
<p>“That there have.”</p>
<p>“Well if you’re the reason we haven’t been overrun by that...”</p>
<p>“Very observant.” She paused, “I would appreciate it if no one knew it were me specifically that was here.”</p>
<p>“I’m not intending to say anything because I don’t want panic.” He considered, “How well can you climb in that form?”</p>
<p>“What, as an elf?  Not nearly as well.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunate.”</p>
<p>“I can climb down looking like an elf if you want.  Any elf.”</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose you can make yourself invisible.”</p>
<p>“I would have a lot fewer problems if I could.” She snorts.</p>
<p>He considered his options, studying her, and decided to take a risk. “I don’t suppose you know anything about star charts?”</p>
<p>That gets an eyebrow raise.  “I do. Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“We found some.”</p>
<p>“Where?  Were they just lying around?”</p>
<p>“Essentially.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie to me," Her voice is calm, but she leans towards him. In the dim light, it looks like her blue eyes begin to glow.</p>
<p>"Where did you find them?”  She asks cooly.</p>
<p>Shadimon pauses, keenly aware of her gaze. He chooses his words carefully, “We found an archive.  Near here.  I suspect you know about it.”</p>
<p>“The observatory?" The glow disappears from her eyes and there is something in her tone he doesn't catch, "You found the observatory?” </p>
<p>She leans forward slightly at his nod, “Did any of the keepers survive the war?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She sighs, and doesn’t answer for a second.  She leans back in the chair and looks away, clearly thinking about something.  A few moments later she looks back. “I think we may be able to help each other.”</p>
<p>“We’ve sent a group there, academics, to essentially...move in. We’re planning to organize; we’re not going to destroy anything.  That’s not what we do.  But we know nothing and some of the initial research - well, they weren’t thrilled with the organization system. It didn’t make much sense to us.”</p>
<p>She snorts a laugh.  “It doesn’t make sense to anyone.”</p>
<p>“Oh good.”</p>
<p>“I’ve used an observatory before.  I know how it works.  I know how to use it.  I understand the organization system.  I can help you understand it, or at least tell you some of what I know, if you help me with something.”</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>She looks at Shadimon for a minute.  She is considering what to do.</p>
<p>Shadimon is keeping his hands visible and away from any weapons he may have on him, but his feathers are fluffed.</p>
<p>“I snuck five messages into your outgoing mail bin. Two are legitimate and three are decoys.  If you promise to deliver them successfully without telling anyone they are from me, I’ll help you." She pauses, then adds, "I swear to you they mean no harm to the ones they’re delivered to.”</p>
<p>“Don’t suppose I get to know what’s in them?”</p>
<p>“Part of the deal.”</p>
<p>“I’ll want some of our mages to check them.”</p>
<p>“They’re not magical," she shrugs, "feel free."</p>
<p>Shadimon comes to a decision, "We can do that.”</p>
<p>“Can I trust you?”</p>
<p>“Can I trust <i>you</i>?”</p>
<p>“Yes," She answers calmly,  "In this.”</p>
<p>Eyebrows hit the ceiling. Shadimon drummed his fingers on his arm, “There will be a lot of questions about how we suddenly have information about that observatory.”</p>
<p>“You’re clever," She smirks at him.</p>
<p>He eyed her, but let it pass, “It would almost certainly be too dangerous for everyone for you to go to the observatory in person.  Even if you were disguised, if anyone found out, they would kill you immediately.”</p>
<p>“I know that. Information only.  I’m not an expert on the subject, but I’ll tell you what I know.”</p>
<p>He glanced at the door and the growing darkness, weighing options. “Are you familiar with the dreamdust elves and what they look like?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of them but never met one.”</p>
<p>“There are some stationed around the village and if you looked like one it wouldn’t be terribly suspicious.”</p>
<p>“I think I can do that.”</p>
<p>Shadimon describes a dreamdust elf (tall, tan skin, bright colors, wide pupils) and the Tourist casts disguise self. She manages a reasonable illusion. </p>
<p>“Come with me.  If anyone asks, this was a repeat of the shelving incident.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Just go with it.”</p>
<p>Shadimon leads her out, looking like a dreamdust elf.  As expected, a group of winged elves are gathered on a nearby ledge. Shadimon waves to them and points over his shoulder at the disguised werewolf. Several of the observers laugh, and the group disperses. He brings her to the town hall area and the small space that functions as an office. It’s not an awful climb to get there.</p>
<p>Shadimon pulls the curtains, takes the star charts from a shelf, and puts them on the table, “This is what we brought back.”</p>
<p>She looks over the star charts. “Well, at least they’re in good condition.”</p>
<p>She takes something out of a bag and sets it on the table.  It is a very small orrery made of brass and mithril.  It shows some kind of celestial bodies.  She folds her hands, looks at how Shadimon is staring at the orrery.</p>
<p>“You know what this is?" She asks as Shadimon gives the device a blank look, "You may want to fetch a scholar."</p>
<p>Shadimon raises a sardonic eyebrow  He debates, and then leans past the curtain to request someone fetch Anasatri. </p>
<p> Sitting back at the table, he said, “The one thing that will make this less suspicious is that the dreamdust elves are nocturnal and nomadic.  They navigate by stars.”</p>
<p>“So you want me to not tell her who I am?”</p>
<p>“No.  She’s extremely good at what she does, but...not great at discretion.”</p>
<p>"Then we agree."</p>
<p>Shadimon explains that dreamdust elves has names such as Pebble, Dust, and Steve. Momentarily perplexed, the Tourist settles on Dusk as a code name.</p>
<p>"Well, it's better than 'Moon,'" Shadimon grumbles under his breath.</p>
<p>Moments later, the curtain flies open for a very interested and enthusiastic looking elf.</p>
<p>“Oh good," Shadimon smiles at Anasatri, "We have a possible expert on these star charts and I need you to translate into something I understand.”</p>
<p>“Ooh!” Anasatri slid onto the bench next to Shadimon and grabbed a stack of paper and a pen. Once she was settled, she turned her intense stare back to the werewolf. </p>
<p>“I’ve seen one of these observatories before," "Dusk" begins as she gestures at her device, "This is an orrery.  It precisely tracks the movement of celestial bodies. In this case the sun, the world, and the moon.  The device in the observatory is a far, far, larger and more complicated version of this.”</p>
<p>Anasatri was transcribing in a messy shorthand, “It was mostly in pieces from what our scouts reported.”</p>
<p>“Oof," Dusk chews on her lip  "There should be a crystal in the floor.  If you light up a light source beneath it it will project a start chart on the interior of the dome. By matching the calculations of the orrery with the star charts according to the projection, you can calculate the exact positioning of the stars by time and location. This is accurate down to the hour, and location within a few miles depending on how well you calculate. It can calculate the stars anywhere on the surface of the world, and any time within oh, a few thousand years depending on the observatory. If the projection is intact, you should be able to recreate the orrery itself by referencing known dates and locations in the charts. With a hint, Lycans started all their calculations from the moon. That is the most basic use. Lycans claimed they could use it to predict the future or even communicate with their deity. I don’t know if any of that is true, but they definitely used it to enhance the accuracy of certain magical rituals, mostly divination. I’ve also... <i>heard</i> of their catalog system. I can write down the basics, but it’s kind of dense even for me.”</p>
<p>She writes out a basic explanation of how the unnecessarily complicated catalog system works.  She has very tidy handwriting.</p>
<p>Anasatri has a great many questions, and they went back and forth for a minute.</p>
<p>The Tourist answers as best as she can, but as Anasatri asks some rather pointed questions she holds up her hands. “Just me, Dusk the dreamdust elf with the unnecessarily dramatic name, wouldn’t know anything about that, ah yep.”</p>
<p>Finished with her questions, Anasatri gathers up all of her copious notes and organizes them neatly to send with a messenger to the watchtower.  She leans in to hug the werewolf, but accepts the polite refusal. “That’s fine, thank you for all this!”</p>
<p>Then Shadimon and Tourist are alone again.  </p>
<p>“So these messages you’re sending.  Two are legit, and three are fake?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct.  I would assume you would rather not deliver the fake ones as that might damage your reputation.”</p>
<p>“It would.”</p>
<p>The Tourist is silent for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“The two messages I want you to deliver are the ones to The Hunger and Litoria Hylidae.”</p>
<p>Shadimon's eyebrows must be peeled off the ceiling again. The Tourist leads Shadimon back down to the mail box that she has snuck the messages into. She pulls them out and hands the whole lot to Shadimon.</p>
<p>“The ones to Dust, Shyrendora, and Ehra Indrek are fakes.  You can do whatever you want with those.”</p>
<p>Most are simple sealed letters, but the one to the Hunger is a package.  It kind of jingles, like it’s full of coins. Shadimon has a good idea what it might be.</p>
<p>“It was surprisingly pleasant doing business with you.” The Tourist inclines her head to Shadimon.</p>
<p>“Likewise.  I’m just wondering how Hunger is going to receive that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, he’ll probably throw a fit.” She smirks.</p>
<p>“I almost wish I could see that. Follow the path to the right; it will take you to the rim of the canyon.  No one should bother you as you’re leaving." Shadimon gives her a careful look, "And really, if you need something else, leave a note addressed to Shadimon in one of the buildings at the top of the canyon and it will get to me.”</p>
<p>“That will be significantly less trouble.  Thank you Shadimon.” She gives him a polite bow, then heads for the door with measured swift steps. She stops and turns back in the doorframe.</p>
<p>"I'd rather it be in your care than crumble to forgotten dust," She speaks quietly, "Take care of it."</p>
<p>Shadimon nods.</p>
<p>Without another word, the Tourist leaves.</p>
<p>As soon as he is absolutely sure the werewolf is gone, Shadimon collapses on his table. There is muffled yelling.</p>
<p>-FIN-</p>
