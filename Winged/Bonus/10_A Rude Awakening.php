<h1>A Rude Awakening</h1>

<p>Consciousness rudely greeted Shadimon.  Dull pain pulsed from his toes to his wingtips. It could be worse. Pain meant he was alive. He struggled to open his eyes and move to a seated position. His body felt sluggish, and he jerked in surprise as he felt a hand firmly press on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Woah,” a voice spoke, “Slow down, amigo, I’m not done!”</p>
<p>Shadimon opened his eyes. He was sitting in a small brick jail cell. The room had no windows and was only illuminated by dim lamp light. There were heavy iron bars at the far end, with two armed Coyote guards standing outside. He noticed he was laying on a basic wooden cot,  with his arms and legs shackled to a long chain connected to the wall. He realized his pain was not as bad as he expected. His injuries were bandaged, his broken leg splinted, and arm slung.</p>
<p>There was someone else in the room with him, touching his wing. The man was a coyote elf, though not particularly tall or imposing looking. He wore a simple habit made of undyed cotton with a red cross embroidered on it and had a shaved head. Oddly, he was wearing three separate holy symbols: One for Almada, one for Calestros, and one that Shadimon might recognize as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/blackfeatheradventuringcompany/adventurer-s-travel-guide/religion/minor-deities#TOC-Saint-Errigal">Saint Errigal</a>. The man was currently binding a splint onto Shadimon’s injured wing.</p>
<p>“Hey, relax,” the man continued, “I’ve never done this to a wing, si?”</p>
<p>Shadimon relaxed slightly. Someone carrying that many holy symbols had to be a healer, and if he had wanted to harm him it would have been easy before now.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” the man finished binding the wing and stepped back.</p>
<p>“I hope that is okay,” he looked at Shadimon, “I only got a little magic healing. I put as much as I could into the wing, but it still wasn’t quite right. Here, sit up slow…”</p>
<p>The man dug in his satchel and passed a small clay jar of water and an earthenware plate with some dried meat and cheese on it to Shadimon. </p>
<p>“I’m Brother Matías,” he smiles flatly. </p>
<p>Shadimon shifts, wincing as his assorted injuries protest, “Did fine, thank you.” He sips the water and does his best to not wolf down the food in an <i>entirely</i> uncivilized manner. “They want me alive, I see.”</p>
<p>Matías nods solemnly, “Yeah. Coyote lets me do what I do, but only ‘cuz it’s useful to him. Wish I could do better, but I’m just a novice and the only one left around these days. We do what we can, si?”</p>
<p>“You do, and I’m grateful.” Shadimon ran his good hand over his head, finding the spots where he hit the ground and wincing. “So what happens now?”</p>
<p>The novice lowers his head slightly, “Now I have to tell Coyote you’re conscious. He wanted me to get you stable enough for a ‘chat.’”</p>
<p>Matías winces, “He wanted me to clip your wings too. I managed to convince him it’s not safe until the broken one heals. Not like he knows any better,” he glances up at Shadimon, “I know we’ve gotta look pretty bad to you, but try not to judge us too harsh. We’re all that’s left of once good people.” </p>
<p>“So are we,” Shadimon murmurs. “We won the war, but we all lost a great deal.” He glances up, “At least I assume that’s what happened to you. I’ve seen your silver weapons.”</p>
<p>“Si,” he nods, “More than one war. When we rebelled, we allied with the Hobgoblins when they pushed north. It lasted ‘til it didn’t. Once it looked like we’d won, they turned on us. Told us they,” he grits his teeth, “weren’t gonna give up on such good slaves after they fought so hard to take ‘em.”</p>
<p>He slumps his shoulders, “Without Breaker and Coyote, we’d still be in chains. Even with ‘em, we only just barely won.”</p>
<p>“Ahh…” Shadimon says quietly, drawing it out. “I see. And now you hold what you have like your lives depend on it.”</p>
<p>"Si, cuz it does," Matías nods, "Freedom and life are the same thing, and everyone who ain't one of us wants to take one or both away. No matter what they say to your face. I know it doesn't…"</p>
<p>One of the guards clangs his baton on the steel bars and yell, "Hey padre, that pollo looks pretty chatty to me."</p>
<p>"I ain't a padre," Matías yells back, "I'm <i>assessing</i> my patient, you ever treat a head injury other than the one su madre gave you?"</p>
<p>"Vete a la mierda padre, I'm gettin' Coyote before he strings us all up by our ears," the guard drops a few more expletives and leaves Shadimon's sight outside the cell. Moments later there is the sound of a door slamming.</p>
<p>Matías shoots a rude gesture where the guard was once standing then turns to Shadimon, "Sorry, flap. Only got a minute or two. Por verdad, you okay?" </p>
<p>“You’re wrong, you know,” Shadimon says quietly, looking toward the door. “We would have welcomed you as friends. Who knows, maybe we still can.” He glances at Matías, “We only won our war through an alliance of elves. You’re elves, you fought Lycans, that makes us allies.” He leans back, trying to find some kind of comfortable position against the wall, “I’ll be fine.” He pauses, “What does ‘pollo’ mean?”</p>
<p>Matías taps the St. Errigal pin on his habit, "Didn't say it was right or wrong, but it's how my flock think. Me, I got a little more hope for the world than that. I'm only one, though. Coyote don't have much use for the gods, and I'm all that's left of the clergy. I gotta serve two different gods as it is. If I say something stupid and get strung up, he'd probably turn the church into a brothel. I keep my head down and keep people healthy, so he gives me a little wiggle room, si? I can't risk that."</p>
<p>He pauses, "But I pray you're right. Uh, and Pollo means a chicken."</p>
<p>Shadimon snorts, then winces and presses his arm against his side, “Could be worse.” He glances at the door again, “Any advice that won’t get you killed?”</p>
<p>Matías shakes his head, "Not much, other than don't piss Coyote off. He ain't plannin' on torture, far as I know, but he's the type who pulled wings off flies as a kid, si?"</p>
<p>The novice glances at the remaining guard, then back to Shadimon.</p>
<p>"He's probably almost here, I should check that wing split just to be sure."</p>
<p>The split seems fine, but Matías checks it over anyway. As he is checking the ties, he leans over slightly to Shadimon and whispers out of the side of his mouth.</p>
<p>"He'll lie. Asavardi is okay. Don't mention the sheriff, he'll kill you."</p>
<p>With that, Matías leaned back and speaks normally, "I think it's good for now." </p>
<p>Shadimon cut his eyes over to Matías, a brief flash of rage visible before he tamped it down.  “Thank you. You did well for your first try on a wing. Should you go, so he doesn’t take anything out on you?”</p>
<p>“No,” Matías glanced back, “It’s best not to…”</p>
<p>The door to the cell audibly opened. The guard  walked in first, followed by someone Shadimon could only assume was Coyote. For a man with such a reputation, he didn’t quite cut the figure he was expecting. He was a thin man with tan skin and dark hair, not exactly imposing and wearing blue-toned clothing that appeared finely made. Maybe even the same textiles they had stolen. He had  the winged elf feather tucked into his waistband. His figure wasn’t imposing, but there was something chilling behind his eyes and slight smile. </p>
<p>“Out, padre,” Coyote spoke in a voice that was at once gentle and deadly.</p>
<p>“I’m not a…” Matías turned to Coyote, but fell silent.</p>
<p>“<i>Out.</i>”</p>
<p>“Si.” Matías closed his mouth.</p>
<p>The novice gave Shadimon a worried look, but nodded and stood. He exited slowly, leaving the cell and walking out with forced confidence. Coyote watched him leave out of the side of his eye, then entered the cell. He leaned casually against the far wall and tipped his hat at Shadimon.</p>
<p>“Hola, Pollo,” He smirked, “How’s the wing?” </p>
<p>Shadimon nodded his head slightly, “Healer did a decent job for having no experience.” His posture is slumped and there’s obvious pain and exhaustion in his voice.</p>
<p>Coyote chuckled cheerlessly, “Yeah, those wings get to be a bit of a problem for me, no? Good thing they’re just flesh and bone. The breakin’ is easier than the fixin’.” </p>
<p>“Always is.” He glances at the offending wing, “Good shot, from whoever got me. Very good.”</p>
<p>Coyote shrugged, “We knew you were coming. I had a few potions of true strike handed out, made sure my best archers were on duty. It was still a lotta luck, but hey, I only gotta get lucky once.” </p>
<p>Shadimon let just a hint of aggravation show in his sigh, “And I only have to be unlucky once.” He squinted at Coyote, not trying to hide the pounding in his head, “So here we both are. Now what?”</p>
<p>Coyote casually flipped the feather out from his waistband, “Oh, not much, now. I let su amigos know we’ve got you. Gonna let ‘em stew on that for a few days, then see what we can get ‘em to give us. They’ll probably be real willing to listen after what we did to Asavardi.” </p>
<p>Shadimon narrowed his eyes, “And what was that.”</p>
<p>That same cold smile returned to Coyote’s face, “Same thing we always do, Pollo.” </p>
<p>Shadimon met Coyote’s stare for a long moment, “And why is that, I wonder?”</p>
<p>Coyote laughs, “You were at war for how long? Pollo, you gotta know how things work by now. You got friends, sure, but you didn’t get rid of the Lycans by askin’ em real nice. From what I see, sure didn’t help with Lock either.”</p>
<p>“No, but we didn’t start that cold.” He rubbed his head with his good hand, “But, you’ll forgive me if I continue believing things aren’t as bad as you imply.” He winces, “Worrying around a concussion is difficult.”</p>
<p>“No no, no  worries,” Coyote shrugs, “You’ll just have to let me know if that keeps working out for you this well. Ah, Pollo, you’re banged up I know. I won’t keep you busy too much longer. I had a reason for coming to talk to you.”</p>
<p>Coyote pulled a piece of paper from his pocket. He unfolds it and lays it on the ground in front of Shadimon. On it is a detailed drawing of the cliffs of Asavardi, specifically the houses. A few of them are labelled, including Shadimon’s house with Tathariel’s name as well.</p>
<p>“We got people in Asavardi,” Coyote’s tone is polite, almost cheerful, “You be a good pollo and stay in your cage, they won’t have a feather ruffled. You start causing me trouble and doing things I don’t like, I start killing people you like. Understand?” </p>
<p>Shadimon stared at the map, eyes narrowed and feathers slicked back. His voice is curt and to the point, “Quite well, yes.” </p>
<p>“Great!” Coyote smiled, “Then we got an agreement. Thanks, Shadimon. It’s been a pleasure. I know you got a real bad headache, so I won’t bother you more. Don’t wanna stress you out!”</p>
<p>“Been a pleasure. Enjoy your evening, or whatever time of day it is.”</p>
<p>Coyote pockets the feather and tips his hat, “Evening.”</p>
<p>With that, the bandit warlord steps out of the room. The guards lock the door behind him. They resume their posts and mostly just stare at Shadimon. His body aches.</p>
