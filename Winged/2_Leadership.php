    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <h2>Central Leader</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Shadimon</b> began the resistance as a scout, barely out of adolescence, and had become one of the main leaders of the winged elves by the time actual war broke out. He was a survivor of the Fire that destroyed the winged elves’ ancestral forest, and aided in the scramble to get people relocated and somewhere safe. He is quietly competent, less boisterous than is typical for a winged elf, and his calm confidence helped hold his people together.</p>

<p>Leadership is something Shadimon never actively sought out. When they were routed from their forest, he and others saw the potential for panic, and took control. After the War, he would dearly love to hand over the leadership mantle, but no one will let him.</p>

    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> If not me, then who?<br/>
       Shadimon is the only surviving leader who is capable of carrying his people forward. Though he jokingly complains about the responsibility, he is deeply dedicated to his people’s welfare.
    </p></p>

    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Stoic Silence<br/>
    Shadimon is suffering after the War. He lost all of his family, and has shied away from close relationships since. He hides his pain and is prone to working himself to exhaustion.
    </p></p>

    <p><b>Character Levels:</b> Fighter (Harrier)</p>

    <h2>Military</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Shrike</b> has started to find her feet post-War. She is settling into the role of military commander, aided by her training with the Blade elves. </p>

    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> People’s Champion<br/>
       Shrike will stand steadfast between her people and any threat. Since the War, her definition of ‘her people’ has expanded to include other elves as well.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Emotional Whiplash<br/>
        Shrike truly entered the War after the deaths of her children, and threw all of her grief and fury into turning herself into a martial force that she’s a little unsure about in the post-War aftermath. Her emotions run very high, and she has a hard time holding onto them.
    </p></p>
    <p><p>
    <p><b>Character Levels:</b> Monk (Martial Artist)</p>

    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Baijani</b> was another survivor of the Fire, and many credit her for holding them together and keeping the refugees alive long enough to find allies. She is fiercely dedicated to her people, and quietly reinforces Shadimon’s leadership with a glare that can strip paint.
Baijani is one of the oldest surviving winged elves, and is the defacto high priest. Both of those factors make her a very popular confidant for many people. She combines spirituality and practicality into a formidable problem-solving capability.
</p>
    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Ducks in a Row<br/>
        Baijani is ruthlessly competent and analytical. Her militant organizational skills are possibly supernatural.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Self-Flagellating <br/>
        Baijani sees other elves as her children and grandchildren, and the deaths of the War weigh very heavily on her. She is prone to self-blame, bitterness, and overprotectiveness.
    </p></p>
    <p><p>
    <p><b>Character Levels:</b> Cleric (Domains: Healing, Madness)</p>

    <h2>Scoutmaster</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Varna</b> is young, and only really came to prominence after the war. He served as a scout, and hasn’t seen much up close fighting, and he was spared many of the atrocities of war. As a result, his optimistic personality hasn’t been tarnished, and he is full of boundless energy. He’s taken charge of the scouting expeditions into their new territory, and has shown himself to be both sharp-eyed and smart. He and his corp of scouts, many of whom are younger like him, want to know every hill and valley of their new land, and they are constantly looking for anything that could be useful.</p>

    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Glass Half Full<br/>
        Varna is cheerful and optimistic to a fault, and is well-liked and well-suited to his position.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Glass Half Full<br/>
        Varna hasn’t had the optimism knocked out of him, and now that war is over, he assumes things are good, the danger is over, and it’s time for <i>adventure</i>.
    </p></p>
    <p><p>
    <p><b>Character Levels:</b> Rogue (Scout)</p>

    <h2>Ranger-Lead</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Dhakamari</b>, like Varna, came into prominence after the War. He started as a ranger, and slowly moved his way up until he was a leader of some of the field teams. He did his job well, but really made a name for himself during the flash flood that nearly destroyed Partager, the river elf flotilla. He led his exploration team on a reckless flight to outpace the water and warned the river elves just in time. Since then, he continues to be dramatically heroic, but tries to deflect any praise or admiration he receives, saying only that it’s what anyone would do.</p>

    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Heroic Tendencies <br/>
        Dhakamari believes very strongly in doing the most he can to help and support this growing elf nation. He is willing to go above and beyond what would ever be expected of him.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> Self-effacing<br/>
        However, he doesn’t want praise or recognition for his actions. It makes him uncomfortable, and he worries it will go to his head. So he goes hard the other direction, blowing past ‘modest’ and straight into being self-effacing and aggressively humble.
    </p></p>

    <p><b>Character Levels:</b> Rogue (Scout)</p>

    <h2>Loremaster</h2>
    <!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE -->
    <p><b>Anasatri</b> is in charge of the long memory that makes up the cultural identity of the winged elves, and tries to be everywhere at once, talking to people and collecting stories. She is the last surviving Loremaster, and is responsible for the entire known history of the winged elves. She is cheerful to a fault, extroverted and excietable. She never misses a chance to see new things or talk to new people, and having a polite conversation with her will immediately put you in the 'friend' category.</p>

    <p><p><b>High Concept:</b> Tapestry of Memory<br/>
        Anasatri’s vast repository of histories and stories are an invaluable resource, and give her endless ideas and answers to questions.
    </p></p>
    <p><p><b>Trouble Concept:</b> What if what if what if?<br/>
        However, because she knows so much, she agonizes over making decisions, constantly worrying over the possible outcomes.
    </p></p>
