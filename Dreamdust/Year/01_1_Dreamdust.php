<p>The Dreamdust elves corral their goats and dogs and people, and start heading south along the river, in the company of a whole bunch of other elves.  When the river bends sharply, we strike out southeast, making camp a bit southeast of the fork in the (?) River.

<p>Dust asks Steve and the other oracles to look for omens, and determine the best directions to start scouting.  I’ll also use a fate point to motivate this aspect, and start experimenting with some rituals for finding oases and good sites for wells.  We don’t want to be tied only to the river, we’d prefer to range farther afield.

<h2>Turn 1 Results
</h2>
<p><b>Economic-</b> Congratulations! The settlement of [Trade town] has been founded! The trip up the river was surprisingly pleasant, for the most part. The first leg was quite nice, with all of the elves travelling together and feeling optimistic it had almost a party feel to it. In fact, you were even able to witness a River elf river bond ceremony. You left first, a few days after that. The Dreamdust elves are no strangers to striking out and settling somewhere new, and this is no exception. Even better, these scrublands are a little easier to travel than the deserts you used to call home. The terrain is a bit rougher with more hills and rocks, but there is also more water and plant life. To make your travels easier, you have brought exactly enough supplies to start the town. Your calculations were correct, of course, and you have just enough materials to get things started. The location provides good access to the river, which happens to be fresh cool water. Good stuff!

<p><b>Political:</b> Turns out, flappies are both very trusting and very distractible. A few well-placed special confections is all you need for your spies to have an in with the flappies. Your contacts swear they’ll keep it on the down low, and you’re pretty sure they’re not going to go blabbing to the first person who asks.

</p>
<p>The winged elves have currently set up a settlement, Asavardi, in the square immediately north of Goldfall waterfall. It has the following statistics-
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Name:</b> Asavardi

</li>
<li>Empty Slot
</li>
<li><b>Garrison:</b> Currently full with the Harriers
</li>
</ul>
<p>The winged elves are currently scouting around the area, and have sent out pathfinders. They seem to be a bit late returning, at least while your spies are there.
</p>

<p>Interestingly, your spies find out that the winged elves are putting together some kind of informal research team in order to foresee potential dangers and… oh… oh these poor babies. They’re wildly disorganized. They spend hours every day just coming up with completely wild theories about the absolute crazy stuff that could happen, like Lycans are actually just hiding and the planet is an egg. That last one may have been a result of slipping them some confections.
</p>

<p>(Assuming you do decide to give the poor flappies a boost die)
</p>
<p>Feeling sorry for these poor disorganized souls, your spies sneak into the home of one of the more prominent researchers and arrange their files. Poor thing had them total train of thought, no organization at all. Some basic alphabetized folders and nicely organized category tabs. Yeah, that should help them out!
</p>

<p><b>Military</b>
</p>
<p>Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a unit of Level 2 rangers, in the Angora division.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, related to your Event (see below) people are a little too busy with their own affairs for military recruitment right now. Next turn, you will have a setback die if you make any recruitment checks.
</p>

<p><b>Mental</b>
</p>

<p>Part 1 Creation- Unfortunately, using mysticism sometimes has its downsides. Between casting the bones, psychedelic visions, and maybe some glossolalia, you get… somewhat concerning results. When asking where to scout, half of your portents say “EVERYWHERE!” and the other half say “NOWHERE!”
</p>
<p>This isn’t actually causing a problem, it’s just very frustrating.
</p>

<p>Part 2 Magic- Congratulations! Your sand magi are able to come up with a new ritual. It was a bit tricky as water has a grounding effect on water, but basic detection magics are quite common and many of your magi know the basics of them. They are able to hash out a basic detection ritual- 
</p>
<p><b>Risk-</b> Low
</p>
<p><b>Range-</b> 15 squares
</p>
<p><b>Target-</b> Up to 4 squares, which must be touching
</p>
<p><b>Difficulty-</b> 2
</p>
<p><b>Effect-</b> This ritual will tell you which, if any, of the targeted squares contain any Aspects related to bodies of potable water. It will not tell you the specific Aspects or their exact location in the square, only that they exist.
</p>

<p>Further research checks could be used to improve this ritual.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately there’s a minor incident during the ritual research. One of your magi fails to remember that nearly everything - from people to the air itself - technically contains water. For about six seconds, everyone in your magi is briefly aware of every mass of water greater than a drop in a two hundred mile radius. They’re able to shut down the ritual before anyone actually gets hurt, but your magi will be sleeping off a collective migraine for a few, oh, months. Any magic-related checks next turn will take a setback die.
</p>

<p><b>Event</b>
</p>
<p>Things are going pretty well for a few months, but as your settlement starts to get established some concerning events start happening.
</p>

<p>During the day, while most of your elves are asleep, bandits or raiders of some kind have started stealing supplies from your settlement. Your guards do their best to keep an eye out, but these pesky thieves are sneaky and they strike when the sun is brightest.
</p>

<p>It’s mostly an annoyance at first, but the thieves start to get more bold. They start to become more vicious over time, with goats being stolen and tents being cut through.
</p>

<p>Late in the season, they finally become violent. One of your guards gets a good look a the culprits- short wide Lizardfolk, with bumpy brown scales and spiky heads. This last raid is definitely an attack. They come with the sun behind them and directly attack the guards. They carry weapons made of bone and armor made of hardened leather. 
</p>

<p>In the melee, one tent is torn to shreds and several guards are injured. Worse, one guard is killed.  Several goats are goatnapped, and  sadly several are killed.
</p>

<p>The lizardfolk mostly barked and hissed in a language none of the guards understand. As they were leaving one of them, who had a crude crown fashioned out of bird skulls, barked at the guards in broken common:
</p>

<p>“You no burn home again!”
</p>

<p>You’re not sure what that means, but the brazen attack has your people worried. It’s getting hard to function as a trading post as most of your elves are putting great effort into protecting their homes. The goats must be protected.
</p>

<p><b>Event:</b> Raiders
</p>
<p>Take one point of property stress due to the damage caused by the raids. As long as these raids continue, you will take one point of Economy stress and be unable to invoke the Trade Town aspect as your people are too concerned with the raiders to be able to fully take advantage of the town’s trading post.
