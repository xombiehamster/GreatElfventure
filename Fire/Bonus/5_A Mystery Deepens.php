<h1>A Mystery Deepens</h1>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>“YEEP!”</p>
<p>The Fury nearly jumped out of her skin as she wheeled around on the floor of her shattered studio office.</p>
<p>Ink was standing behind her, in a completely neutral pose.</p>
<p>“... Sorry.” He says after a pause.</p>
<p>The Fury stared at Ink, breathing hard, one hand over her heart -- over the very spot where the Governor had pushed the Phoenix's heart into her chest. "... Not... one for knocking, are you?" she panted.</p>
<p>She hobbled to her feet, and started brushing ash and soot off of her chiton. "Thank you again," she said. "I -- I'm still processing all of what I saw. I thought he might have... figured something out. About the fool, I mean. I didn't imagine the rest. Or most of it, at least."</p>
<p>Ink watches her carefully.</p>
<p>"I may help you," he says, "If you come with me." </p>
<p>"Ok--" The Fury paused for a second. Her hand dropped back to her heart; she dropped her fingers to the spot where the heart entered her, as if feeling for a hole or scar. "All right. Where?" </p>
<p>Ink takes a slow breath before responding.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you where. There will be rules. You will stay close to me. You will create no light and cast no spells. You will not try to determine where you are. You will not speak to anyone unless spoken to."</p>
<p>Ink pauses.</p>
<p>"You will be safe. I promise."</p>
<p>"For how long?" she asked. “Would I be gone, I mean.”</p>
<p>"As long as you ask, only." </p>
<p>The Fury hesitated. "Okay. As long as I can leave when I ask, I can work with that."</p>
<p>"Of course," Ink holds out his hand as if offering to hold hers, "Close your eyes. Do not let go." </p>
<p>The Fury closed her eyes, and reached out, grabbing Ink's hand with both of hers.</p>
<p>Ink and the Fury disappear without a sound.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The shadow plane flows past the Fury like a cold river. She feels less like she is moving through the world and more like the world is moving through her. True to her word, she holds on tight and closes her eyes. Not that she would have done much different anyway. The plane is silent, save for a faint rushing sound like water under a bridge.</p>
<p>She is not sure how much time passes like this. Hours, at least. Eventually, the sound of rushing stops. She feels herself come to a halt. The air becomes simply cool instead of cold, and she hears the sound of insects buzzing.</p>
<p>“Here.” Ink states.</p>
<p>Fury opens her eyes. Wherever she is, it is very dark. Even with her elven vision, she can barely make anything out except for the white outline of Ink standing next to her. She hears insects, and feels soft dirt beneath her feet. She peers at the darkness while her eyes adjust.</p>
<p>She makes out the shapes of great trees, rising upwards. Faint light, moonlight maybe, just barely touches the thick canopy above them. Jungle, she realizes. As she makes out slightly more, she recognizes tall shapes moving among the trees around her. Watching her.</p>
<p>“Come.” Ink calls to her.</p>
<p>She follows his barely visible form through the darkened triple canopy jungle. Among the trees, she makes out large bulbous forms attached to the trunks. Are those… buildings? She sees movement around them.</p>
<p>It is not long before she gets an answer. Ink leads her to the base of a large tree. Indeed, the tree has somehow been grown into the shape of a building. Not large, barely bigger than a small cottage, but a home made of a living tree. Fascinating. If only she had enough light to see how. Ink leads her through a tall door and into the cottage itself. </p>
<p>Inside, she jumps at a high pitched screeching noise. Startled, she looks around for a threat only to realize it’s a sound she recognizes. Ink strides across the room to take a copper teapot off of a bed of coals in a stone fire pit. The dull red glow of the firepit is enough to illuminate the room for her. The main room of the cottage is modest. A small cooking area, with a chimney and a metal box above. There are a few modest pieces of furniture, all of which appear to be growing out of the floor. In an alcove nearby, she can make out a bench with mountains of ink vials, writing tools, and racks of scrolls and books.</p>
<p>Ink gestures to a couch-like branch on the floor. Fury sits. Ink slowly pours the hot water into an earthwear  jug. Warm smells of cinnamon and tea fill the room. He sets the jug on a table and walks back towards the firepit.</p>
<p>“Tea?” He asks. </p>
<p>The Fury nodded, though she was suddenly unsure if she should actually drink anything. Isn't this how fairy stories start? she thought to herself. Strange elves from unknown forests, offering refreshment to the unwary?</p>
<p>Said stories also suggested that refusing at all would be considered impolite, and the impolite tended to meet worse fates than the gullible. "Yes, please," she said, watching Ink carefully.</p>
<p>"Good," Ink continues, "I cannot drink it. I like the smell."</p>
<p>He retrieves something from the metal cabinet and fiddles around, doing something Fury cannot see. After a minute or two, he pours some of the tea into an earthenware cup. He places the cup and a plate containing a small oily smoked fish, neatly cut in two, on the table next to her. He places a similar plate and mug of water on the other side of the table and sits.</p>
<p>"Please eat," he gestures, "And please take off your mask, Aelia."</p>
<p>The Fury froze for a solid minute.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, she pressed a hand to her temple. The mask popped off, unleashing a small puff of acrid smoke, and revealing the face of Aelia Bonebear, barely changed from that of the foolish girl. She dropped the mask onto the couch beside her, carefully picked up the mug of tea, and raised it to her closed lips. She gave it a long whiff, but did not drink it -- at least for the moment.</p>
<p>The tea smells like… well.. Tea. It also smells like cinnamon, but the Fury can see an actual stick of cinnamon in the cup. She can also smell a slight hint of honey, as well as a floral smell she can’t place.</p>
<p>Ink looks from her to the cup as she pretends to drink.</p>
<p>“It will get cold…” He trails of slightly as he looks at her nearly sparking face, “Oh.”</p>
<p>Ink looks down and takes a slow breath.</p>
<p>“I… am sorry. I did not know what you would see. I did not know what I would see of you. It was not… right. I hurt you, and I am sorry.”</p>
<p>Ink’s mouth stays open for a few moments, but he apparently has nothing more to say. He stops speaking, but does not look at Fury’s face. </p>
<p>"No," Aelia said. She stared for a second, and then chugged half the mug of tea in a single gulp. "Don't apologize. You've helped me more with that one spell than… more than you might know. More than I thought it would. More than I knew I needed."</p>
<p>"If anything, I should apologize to you, for not letting you know what you were getting into. I knew something went wrong. I… I knew the Conflagration was my fault. I didn't know the... latrine-smelling son of a rat <i>knew…</i> that he figured it out, I mean, but I should have. And I should have told you what I knew."</p>
<p>She set the mug down. "The ritual. What he did to the Phoenix. Do you know what he was trying to do?"</p>
<p>The tea, by the way, is delicious.</p>
<p>Ink looks back up at her for a moment, “No. Only saw bits and pieces. Filtered through his memory, through your vision. Specifics could be wrong. Dangerous to assume. Definitely bad.”</p>
<p>Ink lets that blithe statement sit for a moment.</p>
<p>“Not my place to solve. Only you can.”</p>
<p>Ae nodded, and then took another sip. "My burden, then. That's fair. It was my failure, after all." She glanced down at her arm. "So… was the tattoo supposed to change like this? It still looks amazing; I was just surprised."</p>
<p>Ink looks at the tattoo, “No idea.”</p>
<p>He takes a quick drink from his mug of water to cover his face.</p>
<p>“I can still help you,” He changes the subject, his voice oddly clearer than usual, “I cannot solve it for you, but you are not alone. Nor should you be. Divination… can break you, if not used carefully. I have seen many divinations, some which cut me deep. I may be able to help you understand what you saw.”</p>
<p>"Please," she said, taking another sip.</p>
<p>“Eat first,” Ink turns to his fish, “Clears the mind. Take your time.”</p>
<p>Several hours later, Ink returns Fury to her study. He merely nods to her before casting a teleport spell to return.</p>
<p>Fury looks at her ruined study.</p>
<p><i>I have a lot of work to do.</i></p>
