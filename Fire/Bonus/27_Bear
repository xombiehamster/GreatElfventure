<p>&ldquo;I think I can see Surt from here!&rdquo; the Fury said, glancing back at her traveling companion and gesturing at the window. &ldquo;The cloud trailing out over that hilltop -- I think that&rsquo;s smoke! And if you look just to the right of it&hellip; there&rsquo;s just a little bit of white peaking out around it that I&rsquo;m pretty sure is stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companion rumbled, like extremely disinterested thunder.</p>
<p>Fury rolled her eyes. &ldquo;At <em>least </em>admit it&rsquo;s a pretty view. This is going to be a really long and disappointing wedding if you can&rsquo;t at least <em>pretend</em> to be excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Terror crossed her arms, and turned to glare at Fury, bumping her knees awkwardly against the leg of the elf sitting across from her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury crossed her arms right back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that look. He&rsquo;s <em>your</em> friend, and it&rsquo;s <em>his daughter&rsquo;s wedding</em>. You should be excited for both -- for all three of them! And having a little fun with an old friend is not going to ruin your reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror huffed, scooting back around to the opposite window, and smacking her shinguards against the elf in front of her in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reputation that could afford to soften a bit,&rdquo; Fury continued. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t going to be the last wedding you&rsquo;re invited to, spoilsport or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may...&rdquo; said the elf across from Terror, actively rubbing at his knees. &ldquo;I--&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror grumbled again. The elf&rsquo;s mouth snapped shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, please, Titus,&rdquo; Fury said, giving Terror a quick frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip; Perhaps a bit of stolid&hellip; <em>presence </em>is appropriate in these circumstances,&rdquo; Titus Sita continued, nodding to Terror. &ldquo;The Hemicyonae family has quite a militant reputation of its own, after all. Sir Phoeberon himself, especially. Perhaps her magnificence is simply trying to provide this wedding with the dignity it deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have dignity <em>and</em> fun at a wedding, Titus, dear,&rdquo; Fury said, smiling at him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Titus frowned. &ldquo;Your grace&hellip; are you certain you are not letting your own excitement get the better of you? This being the first major wedding on Surtian soil, after all&hellip; and I&rsquo;m assuming the first one you&rsquo;d be officiating, as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that&rsquo;s relevant,&rdquo; Fury said, rolling her shoulders back. &ldquo;I am simply doing my part as a member of the Triumvirate to make sure the needs of the Surtian people are met, and their customs respected and recognized by the State. A happy wedding is good for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...As you say, your grace,&rdquo; Titus said, trying to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not going to be the one stomping in, bearing storm clouds,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, your grace,&rdquo; Titus said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought a dress for you, you know,&rdquo; Fury said.</p>
<p>Titus blinked, and then winced as Terror spun, slamming armor into his kneecaps with not a small amount of force. Terror glared at Fury, clearly doing her best to loom inside the confined space of the carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <em>have to</em> wear it,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;I just thought you might want to. Its very chaste. And stolid. Very stolid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror pointedly looked over Fury&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t throw me out at this point without literally throwing me off a cliff,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re three-quarters of the way up the Pegasus Back, and there&rsquo;s not a lot of road on this side. Good luck explaining what happened when you make it to the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Titus, sweetheart,&rdquo; Fury said, turning to the elf. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d tell everyone what happened if the Terror threw me off a cliff, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Titus said, alternating rubbing his kneecaps with trying to wipe steaming sweat from his eyes. &ldquo;Well. Err. I&rsquo;ll just&hellip; get out a little early and walk to the gate, I think. Very pretty day and all, and I&rsquo;m not going all the way to the wedding -- I&rsquo;m just here to survey the excavation projects -- so if you&rsquo;ll excuse me..&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scooted over to the door opposite the Fury&rsquo;s side of the carriage, and hastily shoved it open, revealing about a dozen feet of paved roadway and a thin rope guardrail, supported by stakes. Just beyond that, the road terminated in a wide vista, showcasing a snowy valley surrounded by dozens of rocky hills. From his angle at the edge of the cart, Titus could see that termination point quite clearly -- and that it was a very, very long drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Road is a bit narrow that way, too, Titus,&rdquo; Fury said.</p>
<p>Titus vomited.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Hemicyonae Villa was a fortress-like building on the far edge of the village of Disr, jutting from the northernmost edge of Pegasus Back mountain. Half a dozen carriages and nearly twenty palanquins sat out in front of it, their drivers and bearers lounging around a long table stacked with food and drinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Titus,&rdquo; Fury said sadly, as the Triumvirate carriage pulled up the ostentatiously long drive. &ldquo;I had no idea heights made him so queasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Sir Phoeberon won&rsquo;t mind that I invited him,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re coughing about. And a cake and a party would be good for him. <em>And</em> the CPC helped design this villa; he deserves a chance to see a mansion he helped create. When he&rsquo;s feeling better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror deliberately stared out the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s bothering you,&rdquo; Fury said quietly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re moodier than usual; I can tell that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its my business,&rdquo; Terror rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Is it something I can help with?&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;Something about Sir Phoeberon, or the wedding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror turned a glare her way. &ldquo;You dig too deeply into other people&rsquo;s battles,&rdquo; she said, in a sharp, quiet voice, like chains rattling. &ldquo;And we aren&rsquo;t friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage rolled to a stop, and the driver hustled over to the door. &ldquo;<em>Terror</em> and <em>Fury</em>,&rdquo; he announced proudly, hauling the door open with a rather deliberate cackle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Cassius?&rdquo; Fury said.</p>
<p>Cassius cackled again, and waved toward the villa doorway.</p>
<p>Terror enfolded out through the carriage door, and stormed up the steps towards the villa doors. Fury tagged along in her wake, pressing at creases in her roiling midnight-blue-and-purple dress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stone doors at the top slid slowly open, revealing an ornate entranceway and a large Fire Elf with a surprisingly bushy brown beard surrounding his jaw. Diagonal scars ran across the top of his face, cutting through his nose at the same spot where a chunk of flesh was clearly missing from one nostril. He bent over, gaveiving the two Triumvirate members a deep bow, followed immediately by a salute to the Terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome! Welcome!&rdquo; he said merrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored to see you -- honored to have you both here. Welcome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be sir Phoeberon,&rdquo; Fury said, curtsying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our pleasure. Your villa is lovely. Gorgeous. The view must be amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until you see the dancing hall,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be having the reception there, after the ceremony. A truly breathtaking sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to it!&rdquo; Fury said. Her eyes caught on a trio of blackened scars half-visible on his arm, at the edge of his chiton sleeve. All three were shaped vaguely like stylized arms, bent at the elbow, with open hands; each curved around the one to the left, as if in a larger &lsquo;wave&rsquo; of limbs. &ldquo;...That&rsquo;s a rather interesting tattoo,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. His eyes were fixed on the Terror.</p>
<p>The Terror loomed.</p>
<p>Phoeberon loomed.</p>
<p>Seconds passed.</p>
<p>Fury closed her eyes. &ldquo;Are we just planning on standing here until the wedding?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because to be honest, Cal&rsquo;s grace, this sort of thing is really juven--&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon snapped first, breaking out in a roar of laughter, before reaching forward and wrapping the Terror in a tight embrace.</p>
<p>The Terror relaxed into it, before grabbing Phoeberon in return and lifting the elf a solid six inches off the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a solid six seconds, they both released; Phoeberon dropped to his feet, and let the momentum carry him into a kneeling position. &ldquo;My liege,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And our <em>faithful</em> savior and champion. It has been far too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ease,&rdquo; Terror said, in her normal voice, cracking only slightly. &ldquo;You are well? I never thought I&rsquo;d see you become a civilian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greater duties awaited me,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;And I knew our lives are in good hands. You bear leadership well, as you always have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror shrugged. &ldquo;Where is Cefali?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oiling her bridal dress, most likely,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;And staying out of the festivities; it&rsquo;s bad luck for a bride to party too much before her wedding, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ll drink all of the beer before he can have any,&rdquo; said an elf, coming out of an open doorway at the far end of the hall. She had long bronze hair, woven in a complicated braid, and narrow ears that split in two places on each side. She was wearing a thick, white chiton-dress, cut high on the legs, and accentuated with purple seaems lined with glittering phosphor crystals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She swept over to the front doors, and gave Terror and Fury a low curtsy, keeping her eyes fixed on Terror&rsquo;s mask. &ldquo;Terror,&rdquo; she said, smiling brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cefali,&rdquo; Terror said, her voice cracking. &ldquo;You look&hellip; radiant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; Cefali laughed. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll look more radiant at the ceremony. It's been such a long time -- how are you? Solid as ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror gave a tentative shrug. &ldquo;Bearing it.,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Cefali nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to finish getting ready; we&rsquo;ll chat more after the ceremony. ...Thank you for making it here, champion. It really means a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror nodded.</p>
<p>Cefali smiled, and set off back down the hallway.</p>
<p>Phoeberon glanced at Terror and Fury. &ldquo;Ceremony will be out in the garden, of course -- can&rsquo;t have <em>too</em> big of a fire in the villa -- but we&rsquo;ve set up refreshments in the dining chamber for all the guests. I&rsquo;ll take point; this way please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, and started marching down a side hallway.</p>
<p>Terror dropped a hand onto Fury&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I need that dress,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Fury nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Fury dropped onto a padded wooden stool, steaming slightly. &ldquo;That&hellip; was a bit more work than I expected,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo; But really worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror sat carefully onto the stool beside her. She was wearing a long, loose black gown, cut low at the top, but clearly designed to allow plenty of room to maneuver in the arms and legs. Even so, she kept tucking it back around herself, and checking the sleeves and straps as if afraid it was going to tear apart at any moment.</p>
<p>Fury sat up, and reached for a stone cup sitting on a nearby table. &ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Does Breaker need to be jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror turned a full-power glare in her direction. Guests at tables behind Fury scattered. A passing staff member fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; Fury said, not meeting Terror&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say anything. I&rsquo;m just asking. As a friend. A <em>friend </em>who let you <em>borrow a dress</em> that you suddenly needed after choking up while talking to someone you clearly know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror sagged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bad at this,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me about it,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. I&rsquo;ve been worried about you since the Potluck. ...Honestly, I was pretty certain I was going to have to chase off &lsquo;Echo of Murderhuge&rsquo; for you before we left there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror gave out a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of romance in the Black Eagles,&rdquo; Fury continued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror shook her head. &ldquo;For some,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t stop for it. Wasn&rsquo;t a thing I could carry with me. I had too many other objectives to bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not really much before that?&rdquo; Fury asked.</p>
<p>Terror glanced at Fury. &ldquo;Not much before that period, full disclosure. I enlisted young. A family thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury cocked her head. &ldquo;All right. But you knew Phoeberon and Cefali&hellip; from the Eagles? I thought I knew that sir Phoeberon was in there, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he wasn&rsquo;t in the Eagles at&hellip; at the end. Or with you at&hellip; You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror shook her head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re from&hellip; kind of before. ...Family friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo; Fury said. She turned on her stool and stared over at Phoeberon, who was talking loudly with a half-dozen guests over by a table set with several open amphoras of ale.</p>
<p>The wedding had been significantly more staid than previous weddings Fury had attended or officiated. Not that there had been many. Most Fire Elves still kept to the traditions from the war -- marriage was a long-term tie to someone who may not be there in a century, or a decade, or even a month. Why make a show out of a promise neither side can be sure they&rsquo;ll keep? Maybe, in a few decades, once everyone was certain things had settled. Certainly not yet.</p>
<p>The Ashen had different opinions. Elopements and micro weddings were common -- particularly among the Firedancers, whom (Fury suspected) treated weddings more as an excuse to party than anything actually official. The Ashen kept to small affairs, usually only involving those getting married, maybe a dozen guests, and excessive amounts of food and alcohol.</p>
<p>Like an Ashen wedding, the bride and groom had danced together in a bonfire, triggered by jars of alchemist&rsquo;s flame that each one had shattered at the completion of the &lsquo;story&rsquo; part of the wedding. Their clothes had been carefully cut and oiled to last just long enough for the dance, and the inevitable dash to the bedroom before everything could burn away completely. Fury had laughed with delight at how excited the bride, Cefali, looked as she dashed across the frosted rooftop to the stairwell down into the villa. The groom had been&hellip; less excited; Fury had put that down to nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&hellip; why is he <em>sir</em> Phoeberon?&rdquo; Fury said, keeping her eyes on their host. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve handed out any titles. He&rsquo;s not just making it up, like the Imperials, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Special service to the Lycans, before the rebellion,&rdquo; Terror said. &ldquo;He was&hellip; sort of a troubleshooter for them, around then. Deactivated himself and formed his own cell just after Ehra left, and was successful enough that the title stuck.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury frowned. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t really sound super reliable,&rdquo; she said, turning to look at Terror.</p>
<p>Terror was staring into a cup of water on the table in front of her with, her shoulders hunched like a mountain midway through collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s really nice!&rdquo; Fury corrected hurriedly. She put a hand on Terror&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;And they seemed like good friends to have. And a party is a good time to reconnect with people. Maybe&hellip; resolve some old issues. Cefali seems happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to confront this,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll hurt worse if you don&rsquo;t. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve been down this road before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror glared.</p>
<p>Fury made a face back at her. &ldquo;You put on the dress, so you were either trying to impress her, or outshine her. Or both. And neither of those are really worth it, no matter how much you think they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think what are?&rdquo; Phoeberon said, setting a pewter chalice of ale onto their table.</p>
<p>Fury spun to face him. &ldquo;Minor affairs of state,&rdquo; she said, waving a hand. &ldquo;You have a lovely home, sir Phoeberon. And Cefali&rsquo;s dress was amazing -- she practically outshone the bonfire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon laughed. &ldquo;Thank you, your grace. We had its fabric ordered specially from Riverhaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds pretty expensive,&rdquo; Fury said. </p>
<p>The bearded elf nodded. &ldquo;It was, but I am of no small means,&rdquo; he said, gesturing to the room around him. &ldquo;And on that subject, this seems like a good opportunity to show off some of the wonders we&rsquo;ve added to this villa. And especially to this hall. Would you care for a dance, your grace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury smiled cautiously, before glancing back at Terror.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror nodded, still half-slumped over the cup of water in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I would be delighted,&rdquo; Fury said, flashing Phoeberon a bright grin, and offering him her hand. &ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon took her hand, and hauled her swiftly to her feet, catching her other arm by the elbow as she came up, and stepping in to pull Fury into a close dancing embrace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury laughed in surprise. &ldquo;How very forward of you, Phoeberon,&rdquo; she said, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right this way, your grace,&rdquo; he said, grinning back. He turned, releaseding her arm, and started to lead her to the far end of the hall, where the majority of the dancers were currently spinning, beside a large panel of black-green flooring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was both,&rdquo; Terror said quietly.</p>
<p>Fury glanced back at her, and nodded.</p>
<p>Phoeberon led her to the edge of the floor panel, which he stepped smartly onto, before gesturing downward.</p>
<p>Fury blinked.</p>
<p>The panel was actually a clear glass window, tinted a deep grey, and set just over the edge of Disr's plateau. Sir Phoeberon was standing over a straight drop to the valley beneath Pegasus&rsquo; Back mountain, easily five hundred paces below, with only a thin sheet of plate glass between his feet and the open air.</p>
<p>Fury&rsquo;s smile cracked. &ldquo;Phoeberon, dear,&rdquo; she said, tugging at his hand. &ldquo;Are you sure you want to stand on that? Let&rsquo;s&hellip; take a few steps back, away from the precipitous drop waiting to happen, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon laughed. &ldquo;Nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo; he said, giving the glass a hard stomp with his boot. &ldquo;This is voidglass; its as hard as steel, and thirty times more durable than normal glass plate. I recovered it from a Lycan mansion some years back, and installed it directly into the floor&rsquo;s supports by myself. It&rsquo;s worth a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Fury said, in a voice that clearly screamed &lsquo;not great&rsquo;. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay on this side of the floor, anyway. Look, you can see a caravan coming up the road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. He gave Fury&rsquo;s arm a sudden, hard tug, and heldwith his other hand ready to catch her as she fell towards him.</p>
<p>Instead, Fury dug her heels into the tiled floor beneath her, stumbling but managing to slip her hand out from Phoeberon&rsquo;s grip before he could pull her onto the glass. A bit of internal glow crept up her arms and face.</p>
<p>Phoeberon raised an eyebrow at her, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Just tripped a little bit,&rdquo; Fury said, straightening up, and forcing her breathing to slow to its normal rate. Her eyes stayed fixed on Phoeberon&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we can see from the windows to the right over there.,&rdquo; sShe said, gestureding to one of the far walls. &ldquo;All of this snow must make the hilltops look absolutely divine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Phoeberon genially. &ldquo;After you, your grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>"And you are?"</p>
<p>"T-titus Sita," Titus said, wiping melting snow out of his hair. "Infrastructure chairman of the CPC. I was invited directly by her grace the Fury."</p>
<p>The graey-haired butler gave Titus a bored look, and glanced back down at the gilded clay tablet in his hand. "You are not on the guest list, mister Siva."</p>
<p>Titus nodded. "The Fury invited me this morning. And I know <em>she's </em>on the guest list. Go ahead and check with her if you want. Or with the host. Whatever. Can I just wait in the entrance hall until you find them? It's cold out here."</p>
<p>The elf butler wiped an graey hand through his hair, and then pulled at the ends of his ash-grey mustache. Titus was almost certain he&rsquo;d dyed it. All of it. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, tucking the tablet under his arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that would be against protocol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Titus blinked. &ldquo;So&hellip; am I supposed to wait right here, then? In the snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elf shook his head. &ldquo;You can wait there, if you prefer.&rdquo; He waved over to the stables, behind which a band of increasingly uncomfortable drivers and palanquin carriers were actively huddling behind. A few of them were piling straw and the remnants of the marriage bonfire into a rudimentary firepit. Titus spotted Cassius over to one side, rolling balls of fresh snow into tiny snowmen, and then crushing them with his feet while cackling like a maniac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Asking them shouldn&rsquo;t take very long, right?&rdquo; Titus said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the guests are quite busy with the reception at this time,&rdquo; the butler said. &ldquo;It will likely take until sunset for me to locate either lord Phoeberon, lady Cefali, or her grace. Assuming any of them are in a state to answer such questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Titus&rsquo; jaw dropped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that will be all, sirrah,&rdquo; the butler said. Without waiting for an answer, he marched back inside, slamming the door shut behind him.</p>
<p>Titus stared at the door, grimacing. &ldquo; &lsquo;Lord&rsquo; Phoeberon? My fat ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced sadly over to the band of teamsters behind the stables. Cassius had picked up one of his tiny snowmen, and was laughing in its face while it melted in his glowing hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help design his little &lsquo;temple to elitism&rsquo; here, sure, but can stand inside for a few minutes to get out of the cold? Hells no,&rdquo; Titus muttered, deliberately turning away before Cassius noticed him. &ldquo;Probably going to call it the &lsquo;Imperial Mansion&rsquo; next. ...Cal&rsquo;s grace, I&rsquo;m pissy when I&rsquo;m freezing to death. Great way to die; frozen outside an overstuffed villa-deathtrap I helped build&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Titus paused. He glanced back at the villa door -- still shut -- and then checked the windows to see if anyone was looking out of them. After a moment, he sprinted for the eastern edge of the building, directly away from the stables, and pulled himself around the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t use a servant&rsquo;s entrance,&rdquo; he said to himself, studying the building&rsquo;s outside. &ldquo;Totally get kicked out that way. Couple of secret entryways, but they&rsquo;re probably locked. Wasn&rsquo;t there a&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes fell on a wide window, just above an intricately carved support beam, featuring a bas relief of nereids dancing in the depths of the ocean. &ldquo;There we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed over to the support beam, and started wiping snow off of the edges of the sculpture. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put windows right above a support column, I said,&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put ridiculous mermaid carvings on your &lsquo;well-defended&rsquo; house, because someone might use them as a fucking ladder.&rdquo; He stuck a foot into the gap right above a carved kraken&rsquo;s head, levered himself onto the top of the beam, and crawled carefully over to the villa window.</p>
<p>The window slats had been hooked shut. Titus shook them until the hook came loose, and then pulled them both open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The curtains covering the window ruffled, now suddenly exposed to wind and rapidly increasing amounts of snowfall. Titus stared through the gap.</p>
<p>The room beyond was nearly empty, save for an empty oil lamp, a rug, and a sofa set in the middle. A wooden door sat in front of the sofa, directly across from the window.</p>
<p>Titus hauled himself inside, landing in a heap on the floor. He pulled himself to his feet, wheezing slightly, and then turned and slapped the window slats shut, making sure the hook was nice and tight this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; he said to himself. He brushed the snow off of his head and shoes, and tried to wipe it from his soaked tunic. &ldquo;Mostly perfect.&rdquo; He marched over towards the door.</p>
<p>He made it almost halfway before he noticed the body lying on the sofa.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>"I like the dress."</p>
<p>Terror jumped.</p>
<p>Cefali was standing next to her, in a dress covered in dozens of tiny copper scales. She slid onto the Fury's abandoned stool, propping her elbow on the edge of the table. "The cut is very flattering," she continued, "but it also looks like something you could move in. A champion's dress."</p>
<p>"The Fury brought it," Terror said. "Let me borrow it. To honor your ceremony properly."</p>
<p>"My <em>wedding</em>," Cefali corrected. "Lucky she knew your size."</p>
<p>"It's not the first time she's tried to convince me to wear a dress."</p>
<p>Cefali raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She's like a sibling," Terror said. "Or a lieutenant that's too eager for her business. She's always trying to get involved, even when she shouldn't, because she's afraid of not helping. And thus, isn't helping."</p>
<p>"Sounds familiar," Cefali said, smiling.</p>
<p>Terror said nothing.</p>
<p>"Why can't I remember your name?" Cefali asked quietly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you be with your husband?" Terror asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cefali laughed. &ldquo;Claud had a bit too much to drink earlier,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s going to rest for a while. We&rsquo;ll get back to business later. Right now, I&rsquo;d rather talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small puff of steam rolled out from under Terror&rsquo;s mask. &ldquo;What is there to talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t&hellip; end things in the best way.&rdquo; She tapped her fingers against the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of things didn&rsquo;t end well,&rdquo; Terror said. &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Again</em>,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I remember that much. You took almost everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror shook her head. "We were already&hellip; we were over by then. There was nothing to lose."</p>
<p>"Yes, there <em>was</em>, and that doesn't change anything," Cefali said. She gestured to the Terror's face. "Why did you put that thing on, anyway?"</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Fury laughed, spinning to a stop. "I think that's enough dancing for me, thank you," she huffed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phoeberon smiled. "Tired already, your grace?"</p>
<p>"I don't dance as much as I used to," Fury admitted. "I need a drink."</p>
<p>"Right this way then," he said, gesturing over to an open table on the east side of the gallery. "We opened some of my best ales for the celebration. I'll have my butler bring us out a flight, so you can try them."</p>
<p>Fury shook her head. "That is very sweet of you&hellip; but I've never been much of an ale person. Water will be fine."</p>
<p>Phoeberon nodded. "Perhaps some wine, then? I have a few barrels I took from an old Lycan manor in Novarsk, when I was helping to put down the last of the &lsquo;loyalists&rsquo; there. Amazing quality, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should check on the Terror,&rdquo; Fury said, forcing a smile. &ldquo;And ensure that she isn&rsquo;t actively crushing one of your guests, or something. I have water over there anyway.&rdquo; She let go of Phoeberon&rsquo;s hand, and deliberately turned back towards her table.</p>
<p>Cefali Hemicyonae was sitting in what had been her stool, having a quiet -- and to Fury&rsquo;s eyes, clearly private -- conversation with the Terror. She was leaning on the table&rsquo;s edge, clearly relaxed; Terror was sitting stock-still, as rigid as a flagpole.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>At least they&rsquo;re talking</em>, Fury thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phoeberon grabbed her hand. &ldquo;Best to let those two talk for a while,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They have a lot of history to sort out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury slipped back out of his grip, with practiced efficiency. &ldquo;And what history is that?&rdquo; she said, crossing her arms. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get anything out of her other than &lsquo;old friends&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bearded elf raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;So the champion hasn&rsquo;t told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I just implied that, yes.&rdquo; Fury glared at him. &ldquo;Does this have anything to do with that symbol carved onto your arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon blinked. &ldquo;Symbol?&rdquo; He pulled his sleeves down a little lower. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just an old slave brand. Nothing of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;I know what slave brands look like. Why do you keep calling the Terror &lsquo;champion&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hearing things,&rdquo; Phoeberon said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s thrice you&rsquo;ve lied to me,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;Keep it up, and I might start feeling insulted.&rdquo; She turned and started towards the Terror&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>Phoeberon dropped a hand onto her shoulder. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury took a step back, putting herself level with the much larger elf, and then quickly reached up and shoved Phoeberon&rsquo;s sleeve up over his arm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mark was clearly a brand scar of some kind, but rather than a number of symbol of a Lycan house, it featured a simple figure of an elven woman, surrounded on both sides by twelve arms, bent clockwise and forming a circle around it. The whole symbol was bent and misshapen, as if it had been slapped haphazardly onto him like a leaky stamp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cult symbol, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Fury said.</p>
<p>Phoeberon growled. &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call Terror a &lsquo;champion&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <em>is</em> a champion. <em>Our</em> champion. A champion of Calaestros.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury blinked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed. &ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But not here. Not with so many others listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re <em>your</em> guests,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;What, did you invite a few people you didn&rsquo;t trust over for your daughter&rsquo;s wedding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon stared straight into her eyes. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury frowned. &ldquo;I guess I deserved that, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;Fine. Lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swept over to the eastern wall, dodging around a few occupied tables, and pulled downward on a somewhat off-color candle sconce set right into the middle. A seam popped open in the wall to his right; he leaned over and gave it a quick shove, revealing a short staircase and an unfurnished room beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies first,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Like hells," Fury said, crossing her arms. "I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m stupid enough to walk straight into a rape cave, thank you.."</p>
<p>Phoeberon bristled. &ldquo;A what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He groaned. &ldquo;Give me a <em>little</em> respect, at least. I&rsquo;m not some damn <strong><em>animal</em></strong>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Respect is earned," Fury replied, inspecting her fingernails. "Right now, you're pretty far in the red."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I can&rsquo;t exactly answer your question out here <em>either</em>,&rdquo; the elf growled. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s either in there, <em>with the shrine</em>, the one place probably <em>not</em> full of wedding guests, or it&rsquo;s <em>nowhere</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I just ask the Terror to come with us, then?&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain she&rsquo;d love to hear what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And interrupt?&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Fury glanced back.</p>
<p>Cefali had scooted closer to Terror&rsquo;s end of the table, and was tracing her fingers over Terror&rsquo;s hand in slow circles. Rather than sitting still on the back of her stool, the Terror was leaning forward, whispering to Cefani.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; Phoeberon said, stepping up to Fury&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;I need to get a drink or two anyway. Why don&rsquo;t you examine my <em>shrine to Calaestros</em>, our <em>god</em>, for a moment or two, and when I get back, if you&rsquo;re satisfied, we&rsquo;ll go and invite both of them into this little secret meeting. Satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Fine,&rdquo; Fury said. Phoeberon marched off.</p>
<p>Fury waited until he was all the way on the other side of the hall, having a servant pour beer into his chalice, before turning and glancing into the room.</p>
<p>The room was dark, save for a few lit candles, scattered underneath a wide shrine built into the northernmost wall. A wine barrel sat in the middle of the room, full to the brim with a deep purple wine. A few used cups lay below it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; impressive,&rdquo; Fury said, staring at the shrine. A large figure of Calaestros had been carved into the wall, laced with cracks that looked like they had been filled in with copper. Twelve carved arms jutted out around it, with flat palms outstretched as if expecting gifts. A number of coins, candles, and jars -- and in one case, what Fury guessed was a dehydrated squid -- sat atop them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury took a few steps into the room despite herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shrine was wrapped in concentric rows of tiny script, each line shrinking as it expanded outward, until the ends were merely dots traced in the stone. Most of the lines were illegible -- either in languages Fury didn&rsquo;t recognize, or using letters too warped to really be readable-- but the start of one line, beginning almost at the tip of one of Calaestros&rsquo; fingers, stood out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Draconic,&rdquo; she said to herself. She leaned a little closer to the figure, resting an arm on the barrel&rsquo;s lip. &ldquo;Everything that has&hellip; transpired&hellip; has done so according to my design&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t hear Phoeberon shut the door, or notice him pad up right behind her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He grabbed Fury&rsquo;s arm with one paw, twisted, and drove her head deep into the wine with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Titus gave the body a hard poke.</p>
<p>The elf snorted, mumbling, and then rolled over onto his side, burying his face in the couch. A phlegmatic snore rolled out from him moments later.</p>
<p>Titus stared at him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was a rather pudgy figure, and stark naked, save for a fine coating of ash covering every part of himself that hadn&rsquo;t since been thoroughly rubbed against the fabric padding. A large amphora lay on the floor in front of him, beside an oil-filled pot, with a bronze strigil sticking out from the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the party,&rdquo; Titus said to himself. He popped open the door, and peeked through.</p>
<p>The hallway was empty, save for a single oil lamp. Two pairs of coal-dusted footprints tracked across the tile floor, leading from the open end of the hall, right up to the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left-side bedroom, first floor,&rdquo; Titus muttered to himself. &ldquo;Dancing hall should be towards the back, right above the cliffside&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked down to the doorway at the end of the hall. &ldquo;Here we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chamber beyond was filled with tables, benches, and stools, and topped off with dozens of elves. Most were sitting at various tables, but a decent chunk were hanging around near a set of buffet tables lined with sweets and amphoras of ale. A few others were dancing at the back of the hall.</p>
<p>Titus made a beeline for the buffet, scooping a clay plate off an empty table as he went. He stacked it high with winecake squares and rose hip pudding, grabbed a scoop, and set off for an isolated table in the southern corner of the hall.</p>
<p>The butler was standing in the center, looming suspiciously over a trio of sheepish-looking diners. Titus made a sharp turn to the left.</p>
<p>He was about to sit down and tuck in at the least occupied table he could find when his eyes caught on a dark square at the back of the hall. <em>Curious</em>, he thought to himself. <em>Some kind of terrible, shiny carpet?</em> He shoved a hunk of winecake into his mouth, and went to take a closer look.</p>
<p>His eyes went wide.</p>
<p>In the very center of the villa&rsquo;s overhang, right where the main arch&rsquo;s keystone should have sat, was a thin plate of greenish-black glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morons,&rdquo; he muttered, cake crumbs falling from his lips. &ldquo;Total Bellaphex-damned Vaqueros construction. What, did someone decide to install a skylight <em>upside fucking down</em>? This isn&rsquo;t going to last a year. Whole damn house is going to crumble, and whoever&rsquo;s in it is going to go straight&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared through the glass, at the snow covered ground more than a thousand feet below.</p>
<p>His stomach twisted. The plate clattered from his hand, cracking against the voidglass plate, and scattering cake and putting chunks all across the edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bent over and clutching his gut, he turned and hauled himself over to the nearest table. &ldquo;Total Vaqueros design,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Need to get this place condemned before it kills someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced up. The butler was staring right at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Fuck</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never answered my question,&rdquo; Cefali said.</p>
<p>Terror pulled her hand back. &ldquo;I wanted to stop people from dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blond elf blinked. &ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t have been much of an issue for you, considering. Did it help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror shook her head. &ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So why wear it? You&rsquo;re the Champion of Caelasteros! You should be shouting that at the whole world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop calling me that!&rdquo; Terror said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. Not anymore, if I ever was -- if there ever was such a damn thing to begin with.&rdquo; She paused, and sat up in her stool. &ldquo;I looked for you, you know. You and Phoeberon and everyone else I lost sight of. Every safehouse and bolthole in the city. You know what I found? <em>Ashes.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&hellip; had a plan,&rdquo; Cefali said. &ldquo;We hid below the old shrine, where it was safe, and waited until the door cooled before leaving. We were down there for a full week, in the dark, and then we... came out like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember your father&rsquo;s plans, Cef,&rdquo; Terror said. &ldquo;I remember how often they involved you two safely behind the lines while someone else did all the actual dying. <em>We all</em> wondered what had happened to you; I guess we shouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s our fault?&rdquo; Cefali said, frowning.</p>
<p>Terror sighed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have no one to blame but myself, for believing it. What kind of &lsquo;destiny&rsquo; brings a hero who causes her own city to burn down?&rdquo; She turned around, and propped her elbows on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...What if that was merely part of it?&rdquo; Cef said. &ldquo;The first threshold, at the beginning of something greater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror stiffened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of that,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;And Cal&rsquo;s reach, that&rsquo;s even worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I should go check on Father,&rdquo; Cefali said. She stood up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk more later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror said nothing.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty-nine. Sixty. Ah, Cef! Good timing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cloud of smoke roiled out of the barrel, filling the shrine with the smell of burnt wine. The wine was boiling. Bright, angry red-purple light flooded out from the top of the cask, casting the shrine and the ceiling above in the color of fresh blood.</p>
<p>Phoeberon had a hand wrapped around Fury&rsquo;s arms, and was struggling to hold onto them while keeping Fury&rsquo;s head within the barrel with the other. His chiton had been heavily scorched; his free hand was covered in bright red blisters.</p>
<p>Cefali stepped into the room, pulling the door shut behind her. &ldquo;Drowning her in wine? That&rsquo;s&hellip; creative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has the stink of the Governor&rsquo;s court all over her,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;I knew some of his worms must have made it out. And what better way to hide than in plain sight, eh? An inflated reputation, a few luxuries, and people will believe anything you tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded over to the shrine. &ldquo;String up the manacles, please, dear. I have my hands full at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cef nodded. She pulled a set of chains out from beneath the base of the statue, and began intertwining them with the outstretched arms, wrapping the links over offerings and between candles with practiced grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fares your husband?&rdquo; Phoeberon asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still asleep,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;That desert-elf poison was really effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to buy more. And the champion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cefali paused. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip; different from what I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon frowned. &ldquo;Dredge up any mem-- oh blast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury slipped an arm out from his grip, twisting it underneath herself, and slapping the palm against the side of the barrel. A wave of woodsmoke rolled out from where her fingers touched. She&rsquo;d burned half an inch into the side by the time Phoeberon managed to corral her arm again and pull it up behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traitorous bitch made me lose count,&rdquo; Phoeberon said, glancing back at Cef. &ldquo;Give me a hand with her when you get done, will you? This is like trying to drown an eel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cef nodded, connecting the chains to a series of hooks set into the wall, and then ratcheting them into place. &ldquo;Nothing specific. Laughter, a few sounds and smells, something about sand. Even the wedding just kind of&hellip; blends together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has to be something,&rdquo; her father replied. &ldquo;We had a lot of kindred spirits in the Black Eagles, but not many of them were quite her size. And there could only have been one champion -- I remember that much. But I&rsquo;d think you would remember someone you married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cef rolled her eyes. She strode over to the barrel, and drove a fist into Fury&rsquo;s stomach.</p>
<p>Fury spasmed. The light faded from her skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there we go,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;Looks like fourth time&rsquo;s the charm. Let&rsquo;s get her on the chains before she drowns; we&rsquo;ll need her alive if we want to do this properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He relaxed his grip, and stretched his blistered fingers. Cefali reached for Fury&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Fury spun, glowing full force, dropping into a crouch with both palms outstretched in front of her. Without even pausing to breathe, she rasped out a string of Draconic. Waves of fire rolled from her hands.</p>
<p>Cefali screamed.</p>
<p>Phoeberon roared. He grabbed her arms, and drove her head to the floor with his foot. &ldquo;Good try, but it&rsquo;ll take a bit more than that before you burn me. I&rsquo;m a little more flame resistant than most. Especially now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury coughed, spluttering wine onto the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess a fifth try is in order,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;Help me stand her up.&rdquo; He glanced back.</p>
<p>Cefali was on her knees on the floor in front of the barrel. The scales on the front of her dress had melted into a jagged plate. Her arms and part of her face were a raw red, streaked with blood. </p>
<p>Phoeberon&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; Cef said, staggering to her feet. &ldquo;Just&hellip; felt that well more than I expected to. We can try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Phoeberon shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt, and Cal&rsquo;s grace, I&rsquo;m exhausted. We can make her pay for that later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dragged the spluttering Fury to her feet, and hauled her over to the shrine. He grabbed a pair of manacles dangling from the chain, and slapped them over her arms. &ldquo;Feel free to shout for help,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These walls are nice and thick. You can thank your friends in the CPC for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fury coughed wine onto his sandals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is his majesty these days, hmm?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;...Well, you&rsquo;ll tell me soon enough. Let&rsquo;s see which adder he sent to spy on our champion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran a finger lightly under the edge of Fury&rsquo;s mask.</p>
<p>Fury snapped, driving her teeth into the edge of his hand. A trickle of blood leaked down his arm.</p>
<p>Phoeberon didn&rsquo;t even flinch. He shook her off, and then grabbed her jaw with his other hand, squeezing it shut. He raised a finger up to her mask again.</p>
<p>His eyes caught on Fury&rsquo;s gaze. Hateful. Accusing.</p>
<p>He turned away, and found the same glare staring down at him from the face of the shrine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&hellip;?&rdquo; Cefali said nervously. &ldquo;...What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. He stepped away from Fury, who slumped, closing her eyes. &ldquo;...There are healing salves in the East Hall&rsquo;s closet. Can you make it over there on your own, without being noticed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cef nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk to our champion. Maybe <em>I</em> can dredge some memories out of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced back at the slumping Fury, and then slid the door open and stepped out, blocking Cefali from easy view as she scurried out for one of the halls. He then slammed the door shut behind him.</p>
<p>Fury waited several seconds before staggering to her feet. Her eyes snapped open. Blinding red light blazed out of them.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>"Champion," Phoeberon said genially, setting a fresh goblet of beer on the table in front of Terror. He dropped into the seat opposite, before putting his own goblet up to his lips and taking a large gulp. "Enjoying yourself?"</p>
<p>Terror glanced up. Her eyes caught on the angry blisters covering both of his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit of an incident in the kitchen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing too serious, for elves of faith like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Fury?&rdquo; Terror said cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resting,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. He paused. "Quite strange, for you to associate with one like her. She makes for an odd choice in lieutenants."</p>
<p>Terror shook her head. "She's not. She has her duties, as I have mine. I'm no more in charge than she is."</p>
<p>"You lead the Triumvirate," he said, eyes narrowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm part of it," she said. "Not <em>all</em> of it."</p>
<p>"Master Jimn once said 'those who do not lead are doomed to follow,' " Phoeberon grimaced. "I'm surprised you would not remember that."</p>
<p>"Jimn is dead," Terror said. "And has been for a long time. Are you seriously quoting scripture at me?"</p>
<p>Phoeberon shook his head. "It doesn't matter," he said quickly. "We have more important matters at hand. 'The Fury' was a member of the Governor's court. I'm certain of it."</p>
<p>Terror nodded.</p>
<p>"You <em>knew</em>?"</p>
<p>"She talks like a Lycan princess," Terror said. "And knows more about dresses than she does about magic. While also being the strongest spellcaster in the whole blessed nation. I don&rsquo;t know if they <em>make</em> courtiers more obvious than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&hellip; and you just <em>let</em> her into our court, too?&rdquo; Phoeberon snarled. &ldquo;Let her claim to have &lsquo;saved&rsquo; all of us &lsquo;pitiful elf slaves&rsquo; from the fire? Let her claim <em>your</em> divine gift? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because <em>she</em> bothered to get up and pull people out of it,&rdquo; Terror said. &ldquo;Same with the Hunger, same with me. So where the hells were <em>you</em>, Phoeberon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suffocating at the bottom of a damn well,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;Hiding with my daughter and all the relics we could save while the Temple of Hands burnt above us, until the heat became so intense we cooked. I <em>died</em> down there, Terror. Both of us did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled his sleeve up to his shoulder, revealing the twisted scar midway down his arm. &ldquo;This is from where the reliquary&rsquo;s faceplate melted onto my arm. <em>Melted</em>. The only reason we&rsquo;re alive is because She-Who-Reaches brought us back. Because <em>you</em> brought us back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the champion. <em>Her</em> champion. Who else could have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the hells should I know?&rdquo; Terror said, gravel and steel creeping into her voice. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know you were alive. Cal&rsquo;s breath, I <em>still</em> didn&rsquo;t until after the war. You could have stood with us against Dreyugr. Instead, you and Cef hid, only to reach out now. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hide!&rdquo; Phoeberon stammered. &ldquo;I was busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>hid</em>,&rdquo; Terror said. &ldquo;And left me to pick up the pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby steps first,&rdquo; Fury rasped. &ldquo;Fingers, check. Toes, check. Wrists&hellip;&rdquo; She pulled at the manacles, twisting her arms, trying to squish her hands down as tightly as possible. &ldquo;Very stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned to her left, away from the statue&rsquo;s arms, and then swung hard to the right, around the front of the shrine, dropping into a crouch as she went.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chains rattled against the stone, but held, stopping her a foot before she hit the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury winced. A few sprinkles of glowing blood dripped to the floor from where the manacles&rsquo; edges had shredded her skin.</p>
<p>She glanced up at the statue&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;...I could use a bit of help here, you know?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell on the candles scattered over the statue&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;...There we go,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>
<p>She ratcheted her way back to her feet, and put her wrist up against one of the larger candles, forcing heat into her hand until it glowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The candle melted. Tallow poured over her wrist, slipping under the manacle and catching on the scraped skin around the edges. Fury winced.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, and pulled hard against the manacle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her hand didn't budge.</p>
<p>She tried again, heating her hand up, trying to force the manacle to expand.</p>
<p>The manacle scraped at her wristbone, tearing loose ragged strips of skin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fury grimaced.</p>
<p>She scanned the shrine. The arms and floor were littered with offerings -- more candles, bottles of strange fluids, coins large and small, a dehydrated squid, even scraps of paper, covered in tiny prayers.</p>
<p>She glanced at the dehydrated squid. &ldquo;...Not likely,&rdquo; she growled to herself. She smacked the manacle hard against the side of a stone hand, toppling a few jars of liquid and sending a bone-rattling shock straight up her arm.</p>
<p>The manacle wasn&rsquo;t even scratched. But one of the statue&rsquo;s fingers had shattered.</p>
<p>Fury looked up.</p>
<p>The manacles had each been looped tightly around the two upper-most arms, three feet over her head. Far enough to make unentangling them impossible&hellip; but not quite out of reach.</p>
<p>She smacked a manacle against the first arm, scratching a chunk out of its thumb. And again. And again, until her bones felt as if they had been pushed through a grinder, and the statue&rsquo;s hand was reduced to a fingerless stump.</p>
<p>She pulled at the top chain until it rolled off the arm&rsquo;s stump, and then did the same for the other side, slowly but inexorably chipping away at it until the chain slipped off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two down, ten to&hellip;&rdquo; She rubbed at her sore arms. &ldquo;...Ten is a lot.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She rubbed another candle&rsquo;s worth of tallow under each wrist, marched over to the right side of the shrine, and threw herself around it as hard as she could, crashing to the floor butt-first.</p>
<p>She glanced down. Both wrists were bloody and coated with grease, but she could swear her right wrist bones were just a little bit further up the inside of the manacle's ring than they had been.</p>
<p>She tried again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the twentieth try, her hand slipped free.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone had to preserve what we stand for,&rdquo; Phoeberon said through gritted teeth. &ldquo;Where have <em>you </em>been, champion? I&rsquo;ve seen a whole city full of elves, but not one true faithful among them. Not one monument to Her Hands -- just dregs and pretenders. What, were we not good enough any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror shook her head. &ldquo;It was never about you.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t reach out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You abandoned the faith as soon as it got you a position of power. As soon as you put on that mask. Was power all it was ever about for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Or was it the mask?&rdquo; he whispered. His brow furrowed. &ldquo;We trained you for this, champion. There are all kinds of magic that can control actions, but they only reach so far. If you can hear me in there, reach out. Who controls it? The Fury? The Hunger? Someone else? Something outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Terror glared at him, leaning forward until her face was a handbreadth from his. &ldquo;Its. Not. The damn. Mask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon swallowed. &ldquo;Then why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I failed. Because we failed. Muspelham burned; I&rsquo;m the hells-damned champion of cinders. And all because we got it into our heads that we could challenge the Lycans face to face and win -- no, that we were &lsquo;destined&rsquo; to win! Destiny is wolfshit. I&rsquo;m sick of carrying that burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's ours to bear, as the faithful,&rdquo; Phoeberon said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carry enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are our <em>champion</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were.&rdquo; She raised her hands to her mask. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m something worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old elf growled. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t just get to decide that; we put too much work into making you into one for you to just drop it, because you&rsquo;re upset over a single loss. Muspelham was... tragic, but look at the good that resulted from it. The truly faithful survived -- came back stronger even. Blessed by Her touch. Ready to fight for the true future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror snarled, and moved to stand up -- but paused. &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;made me into one&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...It was always our goal, to make champions,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;Part of the creed for generations. To provide &lsquo;vessels&rsquo; to serve as Her Hands. To help&hellip; move destiny a little closer. You are a true success story&hellip; but you aren&rsquo;t the first. And there were others of your generation that were close, and could still become one in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon grimaced. &ldquo;That would require knowing exactly who you are, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Who your parents were, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Who else?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cefali, for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror paused. &ldquo;We were a hells-damned breeding program,&rdquo; she said flatly.</p>
<p>Phoeberon took a long drink from his goblet. &ldquo;Well&hellip; yes. A long-term agreement between families. That is why it was so important that at least some of it be preserved. Surely you wondered why our family members were so much larger than most? Why the Black Eagles are so much more capable than other legions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror snorted. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t faith, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <em>is</em> faith, champion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Fury clambered back to her feet, and rubbed at the cuts on her freed wrists. Oil and flowing blood ran down the sides of her arms.</p>
<p>"Self care before escape," she said to herself. "Can't escape if you're dead. Usually."</p>
<p>She glanced back at the shrine -- at the shattered arms, and the judging face staring down at her. Or amused -- from this angle, to Fury's eyes, the carved face looked more affable than angry.</p>
<p>"Sorry about the mess," Fury said. "...I may need a little more luck before I get out of here."</p>
<p>The statue stared silently down at her.</p>
<p>"Thanks anyway, then."</p>
<p>She placed her hands flat against her chest, closed her eyes, and muttered a few syllables in Draconic.</p>
<p>The door slid open behind her. &ldquo;Enjoying the party, your gra--&rdquo; Cefali said, taking a few steps down into the shrine chamber.</p>
<p>Fire roiled out over Fury like water crashing against a rock, spraying over and past her and then up the steps towards the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cefali jumped backwards, yelling, throwing a knife towards Fury&rsquo;s back as she went.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The knife embedded itself in Fury&rsquo;s thigh. By the time the torrent of fire ceased, the wound had already closed around it. Thick scabs covered the scratches on Fury&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;...Can we talk about this?&rdquo; Cefali said, from the floor just outside. She rolled back to her feet, pulling another dagger from a pocket tucked into her dress as she went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Fury said, turning around to face the door. Blinding red light poured from every inch of her. &ldquo;Let me tell you why they call me &lsquo;Fury.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of this,&rdquo; Terror said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is not the time to be sentimental,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;We have a duty t--&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror threw the table out of the way, and stood up.</p>
<p>The entire dancing hall froze. The dancers on the far side of the room dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>"I see there's no talking to you, now," Phoeberon said. "No matter. We'll continue this later, then. When you've cooled off a bit."</p>
<p>Terror ignored him. She turned and started for the front hall, dodging confused wedding guests as she went.</p>
<p>She was halfway to the doorway when Cefali caught up to her, coming out of a side hallway from the western side of the villa.</p>
<p>"Wait, please," Cefali said, smiling. "We weren't done talking yet, were we? If my father said something&hellip;"</p>
<p>Terror's eyes caught on a dark red scab, running along the edge of Cefali's face. "An accident in the kitchen?" Terror asked, running a finger gently along the scab's edge.</p>
<p>Cef caught her hand. "Yes! Total blunder on my part. The fire&hellip; I was moving something by myself, and tripped. I'm a klutz."</p>
<p>Terror stared directly into her eyes. "What in your kitchen is hot enough to burn a Fire Elf?"</p>
<p>Cefali swallowed. "The&hellip; firepit leaked. Very dangerous."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cef,&rdquo; Phoeberon said, still standing where Terror&rsquo;s table had been. &ldquo;Come here, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cefali stared at Terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Terror said.</p>
<p>Cef dashed over to her father, leaving Terror to march out through the entryway behind her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that &lsquo;dredging some memories&rsquo;, Father?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Tell me you at least have something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it time,&rdquo; Phoeberon replied. &ldquo;I&hellip; its hard, when I have nothing to work with. I know who she is -- I can feel it -- but to <em>name</em> her is a different matter. There were so many. And all I can get out of here is accusations. She has no faith anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manage,&rdquo; Cef said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Har, har,&rdquo; her father said. &ldquo;Quoting my own words back at me -- that always helps. Go check on our guest; maybe we can get something out of <em>her</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cef nodded. She walked over to the secret doorway on the eastern wall, pulled on the latch, and gave the door a quick shove.</p>
<p>Phoeberon glanced up. His eyes widened.</p>
<p>Terror was marching back into the hall from the entranceway, lightly dusted with snow. Her hammer was in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enjoying the party, your gra--&rdquo; Cef said.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Terror strode into the dance hall, hammer in her hands, snow on her shoulders, and rage prickling at her insides.</p>
<p>Wedding guests scattered before her. Some dashed for the hallways, or huddled in a confused mass at the gallery&rsquo;s center. Others dove under the tables in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She spotted Cef at the back of the hall, stepping through a suspicious-looking doorway into a brightly lit side room. She shoved a table out of the way and marched forward.</p>
<p>A wall of red flame rushed out the door, nearly catching Cef as she jumped back out of the room. She crashed to the gallery floor, rear-first. The tiles of the floor in front of her cracked and charred.</p>
<p>The wedding guests panicked. Most dashed for the entranceway, clumping and shoving as they tried to force their way through. Others stared at the &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; door in fascination, wondering what monster had produced that wave of arcane fire.</p>
<p>Terror knew.</p>
<p>Cef stood back up, pulled a dagger out of her dress, and retreated back to level with her father, shouting something as she went.</p>
<p>Phoeberon, however, was staring at Terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Terror said, in a voice tinged with static.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you know the answer to that, champion,&rdquo; Phoeberon said.</p>
<p>Boiling hot Fury stormed into the room.</p>
<p>Terror&rsquo;s eyes tracked over the scabs on Fury arms, and down to the dagger sticking out of her leg. She glanced at the red boils scattered over Phoeberon&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why though?&rdquo; she said, gritting her teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She attacked us!&rdquo; Cefali said. &ldquo;Father can prove she&rsquo;s working with the Lycans! Champion, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know how much that hurts,&rdquo; Terror muttered. &ldquo;Or why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glared at Phoeberon. &ldquo;So is this who the Grasp is now?&rdquo; she said quietly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"She's a collaborator," Phoeberon said. "If she hasn't betrayed you by now, she will. Have a little faith, ch-"</p>
<p>"Fuck. You." Fury said. "You're one to judge, <em>sir</em> Phoeberwhatever. I'm not the one wearing a Lycan title like it's a fucking badge of honor."</p>
<p>"Everything I did to earn it was to protect the people," Phoeberon said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror shook her head.</p>
<p>She caught Fury's eye, and gave her a slow, deliberate nod. Fury nodded back.</p>
<p>"You can argue that from a prison cell," Terror said, fixing her gaze back on Phoeberon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He grimaced. "...You know I can't accept that, Champion."</p>
<p>Terror nodded. "You never could handle consequences."</p>
<p>Phoeberon scowled. "Arrogance is a weakness. If I have to beat it out of you again&hellip; fine.&rdquo; He gestured over to the far end of the hall. &ldquo;Let us move this &lsquo;discussion&rsquo; over there, at the very least. I want to still have a house by the time we&rsquo;re finished. And most of these tables are rented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror dropped a hand onto a table beside her, and casually threw it into a wall. Goblets and plates of pastries scattered to the floor. &ldquo;Lead on,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Phoeberon grabbed Cefali by the arm, and the two of them marched over to the open area of the hall, stopping a few feet from the western wall. Terror and Fury moved opposite, putting the glass floorplate between themselves and the Hemicyonae family members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Terror whispered, keeping her eyes on Phoeberon.</p>
<p>Fury pulled the knife out of the back of her thigh, and tossed it underhanded out of the way. &ldquo;Angry,&rdquo; Fury said. She glanced sideways at Terror. &ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d told you to keep you armor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror shrugged, melted snow dripping off her shoulders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...I&rsquo;m not going to not kill him,&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to keep burning him if he surrenders, but--&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror cut her off with a wave. &ldquo;Whatever happens, he&rsquo;s earned it.&rdquo; She turned back to Phoeberon. &ldquo;Last chance,&rdquo; she said, in a voice of metal scraping on stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Champion, please--&rdquo; Cefali started. Phoeberon cut her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Facing a master warrior without your armor,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;I taught you better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the master here,&rdquo; Terror said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not?&rdquo; Phoeberon said, shifting his stance. The flesh on his arms and legs rippled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror blinked.</p>
<p>Brown fur sprouted in a wave across Phoeberon&rsquo;s body, starting from his legs and seemingly absorbing his tunic as it raced across his chest, arms, and face. His arms and legs contorted and twisted, forcing him down into a four-legged stance while his chest and spine reshaped into a barrel-shaped, hunched torso. His nose, jaw, and beard melted together into a blunt snout.</p>
<p>He shook himself, scattering loose hairs, and scraped newly-formed claws against the tile floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; Fury said, eyes wide. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a--&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too excited, traitor,&rdquo; the elf-turned-beast rumbled, in a voice only a few octaves from being an unintelligible growl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of your <strong><em>animal</em></strong> masters. Our ancestors practiced this technique well before they ever came near our homelands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hells-damned bear!&rdquo; Fury said. &ldquo;<em>How the hells are you talking?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoeberon charged.</p>
<p>Terror met him just before the glass plate, steam boiling out of her snow-soaked dress into a blinding, ash-strewn fogcloud that followed her movements like an afterimage. She drove her hammer into Phoe-bearon&rsquo;s guts, missing a follow-up swing for his kneejoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phoeberon rose onto his hind legs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pulling your swings!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;You do know the truth! I-aghklak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror drove the butt of her hammer hard into his open mouth.</p>
<p>Phoeberon gagged, seemingly faltering, and then swung both front paws at Terror. Claws dug into Terror&rsquo;s unarmored sides. He leaned downwards, locking her in place, as if lining her up for someone else&rsquo;s shot.</p>
<p>A dagger drove through the fog surrounding Terror. Cefali&rsquo;s dagger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cefali dropped into a crouch right beside her father, and slammed the knife just below Terror&rsquo;s ribs.</p>
<p>Terror staggered.</p>
<p>Cefali twisted the dagger, and then pulled it back out in a quick slice through the side, pirouetting back to a defensive position just out of Terror&rsquo;s immediate reach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her eyes were fixed on Terror&rsquo;s, an unreadable expression on her face.</p>
<p>None of them noticed the tiny bead of red flying past them, until it detonated behind Phoeberon&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The heat struck first -- an almost tangible wave of shivering air that cooked fur and dragged air out of lungs as it went. Flames came in after it, crashing over Phoeberon and Cefali as a red-orange-yellow tsunami.</p>
<p>Cefali shrieked as bubbles of flesh roiled across her back and arms. Phoeberon, however, just shook himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He caught Cefali&rsquo;s eye, and then nodded to Fury, who was standing behind a propped-up table some twenty feet away, and still glowing like an angry red star.</p>
<p>His eyes were off Terror just long enough. Terror wrenched Phoeberon&rsquo;s claws out by his elbows, and then put a hard shove into his guts that nearly toppled the eight-foot beast backwards onto the glass plate he was standing on.</p>
<p>Phoeberon swung down for another set of claw attacks, but Terror twisted into them this time, letting Phoeberon&rsquo;s paws scrape past her sides without getting enough purchase to hold her in place.</p>
<p>Cefali dodged past her, rolling under Terror&rsquo;s swing, and arced her knife towards Fury&rsquo;s heart. Instead, it embedded itself in the sideways table, a handsbreadth below its target.</p>
<p>Fury turned toward her, and exhaled. White-hot flame lept from her tongue.</p>
<p>The flame solidified as it went, becoming a beam of light as narrow as a dagger. It tracked straight into Cef&rsquo;s shoulder, smoking and charring flesh until a line as thick as a single hair shot out the other side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cefali screamed, staggering, barely able to keep her feet.</p>
<p>Phoeberon choked. &ldquo;Just run, Cef,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, you better hope I miss,&rdquo; Fury said, glaring directly into Cef&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Terror said nothing. She hammered a blow into Phoeberon&rsquo;s back-right leg, and then another into his left, forcing him back, trying to topple him to the floor.</p>
<p>The bear turned back to Terror and growled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still holding back, champion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have it in yourself to kill me. <em>She</em> won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slammed a paw into Terror&rsquo;s shoulder, and then missed a shot at her exposed back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cef straightened up, and then turned and dashed for the crowd at the entranceway, still struggling to push past each other as they half-rushed, half-watched the scene behind them. She dodged under tables and past loitering guests, trying to put as much between her and Fury as possible.</p>
<p>Fury sighed, and threw another angry red fireball behind Phoeberon&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Cef dove into the struggling crowd, and disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Terror swung three more times for Phoeberon&rsquo;s exposed gut. The first two connected, shifting the bear slightly backwards. He caught the third one with an open paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pointless to resist Her like this,&rdquo; Phoeberon said. &ldquo;You cannot abandon the burden of faith so easily. Stand down and--&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third fireball -- somehow larger and angrier than the previous two, and hot enough to singe through patches of Phoeberon&rsquo;s fur -- cut him off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He turned a bear-faced glare towards Fury. &ldquo;Would you <em>cease</em> interrupting me with your <em>damned pointless fireballs</em>! Pecking me to death is <em>not</em> going to work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiet popping noises echoed from below him. He glanced downward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aiming for you,&rdquo; Fury said.</p>
<p>The voidglass plate shattered.</p>
<p>Phoeberon dropped without a sound.</p>
<p>Terror peered down through the open &lsquo;window&rsquo;, carefully avoiding the puddle of lost pudding skirting the edge. The bear was already out of sight -- lost in a sea of snow swirling between the villa and the valley below.</p>
<p>Fury staggered up to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>Terror shook her head. &ldquo;I almost left you here with them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Led you straight to them, without even a warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought they were friends,&rdquo; Fury said. She paused. "...I think I'm done with weddings for a while."</p>
<p>Terror nodded. She rubbed at the hole Cef had torn into her side, her fingers catching on the torn cloth around it. "Sorry about the dress," she said.</p>
<p>"Don't be," Fury said. "It was for you anyway. Here, hold still, and I'll see if I can fix you up. ...Then we can go look for a body. " She raised her hands.</p>
<p>"Umm, your grace?" Titus said, pulling himself up from behind a fallen table, some thirty feet away. "You might want to save that for outside. And hurry." He started backing away, towards the crowd now standing around in the front.</p>
<p>"Titus!" Fury said, surprised. "You shouldn't have stayed so close to the fight! I could have hit you with a <em>fireball</em>."</p>
<p>"I wanted to warn you," Titus said, backing away further.</p>
<p>There was a loud, distinct cracking noise, like stone shearing apart. Titus winced.</p>
<p>"That glass was load-bearing," he said quietly.</p>
