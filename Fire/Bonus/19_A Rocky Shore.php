    <h1>A Rocky Shore</h1>
    <p>It’s late summer when Partager reaches the river banks where they have agreed to trade with their Crag.  They begin the complicated task of delivering their shipment of sturdy lumber in exchange for numerous pails of precious and semiprecious gemstones.  Over the past several weeks of float time, Cel and Boots have been introduced to most of the flotilla.  They are, by now, clearly used to her presence among them.</p>
    <p>What the flotilla has not adjusted to is the presence of Crag elves.  This is further exacerbated by the unusual behavior of the Crag this year;  normally, the exchange is a simple affair, but this time, many of the Crag appear to be making some effort to invite the River elves to see the lumber to its destination; even stranger, there are a number of other Crag, wearing long robes with sashes, who have asked to board, apparently with intent to stay among the River Elves for an unspecified amount of time.  And because of this awkwardness during the exchange of goods, Acris and Cel have been given a firm task at hand: they must stay on guard and patrol these banks and make certain that no Wolf Elves invade while Partager is stationary.  It’s an incredibly important task, that could only be given to two such respected individuals.</p>
    <p>Acris stalks through the small number of warehouses and docks in the middle of nowhere with utmost sincerity.  He is pretty sure he could tell someone was a Wolf Elf just by looking at them.</p>
    <p>Cel backs him up, staying a few paces behind him, and keeping to the shadows. Her fingers rub against the fragmenting edges of her sword hilt. She’s almost certain they’re going to see at least one “wolf elf” -- maybe more. Based on the rumors in Surt, they’re quite hard to miss. </p>
    <p>It seems they may not have long to wait;  just as they pass through a narrow alleyway between two closely-set stone warehouses, a sound rings out; it sounds like something being knocked over in one of the nearby storages… but none of the haulers are anywhere near it right now! </p>
    <p>Acris grabs Cel’s shoulder before she can decide to hurry into the warehouse.  With a quick whisper, he casts a Resistance spell for her and then nods very seriously.  They’re going to have to be very careful.  Wolf Elves spread the Affliction just as easily as a Wererat would.</p>
    <p>Cel nods in return, and then creeps a little closer to the entrance of the nearest warehouse. She peeks in, trying to stay low. </p>
    <p>The warehouse is silent. Row after row of boxes stare back at her.</p>
    <p>She steps carefully inside, and over to a stack of stone blocks reaching well above her head, before gesturing for Acris to follow.</p>
    <p>Acris shuffles inside, trying hard to be as sneaky as Cel is.  It’s difficult for him to move as quietly, as his bare feet plap plap plap against the hard ground while he walks.</p>
    <p>Cel, moving ahead, is the first to lay eyes on the figure.  Hidden among the boxes, she can’t see it terribly well; the light in here is dim, the only light source located near the figure.  What she can make out is that it appears to be another elf… which type, hard to say.  It has a large cloak draped over it, concealing most of its features.  However, it appears to be rubbing something onto its skin.  </p>
    <p>As Acris moves behind Cel, however, he can make out more than her in the dim light; whoever this is, they have a roughspun brown cloak over them.  However, as they apply some fluid to their skin, he can catch glimpses under the hood; chin, jaw, ears.  Definitely some kind of elf. </p>
    <p>Acris tugs on Cel’s tunic hem to get her attention.  He makes a vague gesture, points to his ears, points to the stealth elf, and then points outside again.  Hopefully that will have communicated their need to call for guards adequately.</p>
    <p>Cel stares at Acris, and nods. Leading the intruder outside where everyone else can hear them is a <i>great</i> idea, in her opinion. But how?</p>
    <p>She glances at the figure again, and then sticks a hand into her backpack (currently lacking any hippos) and pulls out a Lycan nickel. She glances at the warehouse entrance, tucks a little further into cover, and then flings the coin at the ground halfway between the intruder and the exit. </p>
    <p>The figure stops in place as the coin clinks against the stone floor.  Whatever light was illuminating it gets covered up, plunging much of the warehouse into darkness.  Still, what little remains is enough for Acris to see the elf looking around, but trying to hold very still.</p>
    <p>Acris tugs on Cel’s hem again to get her attention.  He shakes his head as a vigorous no gesture.  He then points outside and holds up two fingers, and mimes them walking across the webs of his other hand.  He sure hopes she gets the idea and gets out before they get spotted.</p>
    <p>Cel nods. <i>Acris is right -- the Wolf Elf might run for it!</i> Ambushing it outside would be a better strategy. She keeps an eye on where the intruder is, and tries to carefully sneak back to the doorway without being noticed. </p>
    <p>As Cel begins sneaking, she detects a noise, just at the edge of her hearing: a soft <i>thump</i>, like something landing on the boxes above her.</p>
    <p>Relieved that Cel is definitely understanding the secret messages he’s passing, Acris feels just like one of the winged elves with their fancy sign language or the dark elves with their ear semaphore.  This is great.  He attempts to make a break for the exit and forgets to be cautious about the distinctive sound of his footfalls.</p>
    <p id="i">PLAP PLAP PLAP.</p>
    <p>The sound echoes through the warehouse.  Oops.</p>
    <p>Cel spins -- first in response to whatever landed on the boxes above her, and then again when she hears the distinct sound of Acris running for it. <i>The enemy must have us outflanked,</i> she decides. <i>Have to buy Acris time.</i> Knowing that this might be her last, desperate act of defiance, she does the only thing she thinks is left to her: she drives her shoulder into the nearby boxes, in hopes of toppling the whole stack. </p>
    <p>The box in front of her creaks sadly. The stack doesn’t even wiggle. </p>
    <p>As Cel glances up to see what effect she caused, she can see a shadow, backlit by numerous small, weathered holes in the warehouse wall, as it glides down from above, landing between Acris and his much-desired exit.   Near the light of the door, Acris can now see clearly what was stalking him; its fowl figure lands and unfurls its wings, its unnaturally long neck stretching out towards the apprentice wizard.  “<i>HONK</i>”, it declares.</p>
    <p>At this loud avian shout, more noises arise from where the Elf once was; a sound remarkably akin to someone beginning to run, slamming into a pile of boxes, and then sprawling on the ground.</p>
    <p>Acris is thoroughly intimidated.  Acris makes a quick calculation and determines that the building probably has a second exit, and the Wolf Elf probably won’t be able to catch him if he runs for it as fast as he can instead of trying to be stealthy.  He pivots and breaks into a run.</p>
    <p>Cel knows a threat when she hears it. She dashes between the feathered beast and the fleeing Acris, pulling a sword free in the same action. She takes a sideways glance for whatever Wolf (Duck?) Elf master this thing had -- one she clearly heard crashing through boxes seconds before -- but then squares her shoulders and gives the beast an hearty glare.</p>
    <p>Midway through the glare, she realizes she pulled out her training sword, not her actual sword. </p>
    <p>Cel can clearly see her original quarry; whatever light it was working by is completely exposed, throwing the elf into sharp relief.  It looks like they fell face down, and so the thick coat conceals most of their form, but their legs and feet sprawl out from under it; shimmering in the light, they appear to be coated in some viscous, blue substance. </p>
    <p>As for the vicious beast, it seems to have some form of low cunning; its beady eyes snap to Cels sword, and it hisses before taking awkward flight up on top of a stack of freshly piled timbers.  From there, it quacks and warbles, but cannot bring its full fearsome nature to bear. </p>
    <p>Halfway across the room, Acris turns to make sure Cel is following and is thrown into a state of total dismay.  Cel is in danger!  The honking monstrosity has her cornered between itself and the Wolf Elf.  Someone has to do something!</p>
    <p>And there’s nobody here but him.  Acris skids to a halt and faces his fears by casting his very favorite-most spell at them.  And that spell is still: “<span class="AcrisMagic">Tremper!</span>”</p>
    <p>He dumps a bucket full of water over the top of the Wolf Elf.</p>
    <p>The elf was beginning to stand to its feet when several gallons of water dump over it. Causing their robe to stick to them, and mixing with the sticky substance, she (for it is now clear that she is most definitely a she) finds herself badly tangled, and slipping.  She tries to keep her feet, but ends up sliding headlong into a nearby barrel… ironically, one full of water.  Sprawled on the floor once more, much of the viscous blue substance has been washed from her skin, revealing a sickly pale grey color beneath.</p>
    <p>Screeching and honking, the fowl beast now disregards Cel, tumbling into the air.  It beats its wings furiously, slowly losing altitude as it ultimately attempts to collide with Acris.  However, it has misjudged the distance, and ends up flopping down several feet short of the River elf.</p>
    <p>Cel dashes after the fat, screeching bird-creature, but pauses as she reaches where the Wofl Elf lies sprawled on the floor. Keeping her training sword at the ready behind her, she bends down, and pulls the hood back off the elf’s head. </p>
    <p>Exposed to the dim light, Cel discovers… a disappointing absence of fuzzy ears.  Instead, the ears appear almost normal, maybe a bit on the smallish side.  The sprawled elf seems… almost suspiciously nondescript.  Black hair, greyish eyes, only thing that really sticks out is the pale, greyish skin… which is still a little coated in blue goo.</p>
    <p>As the hood is pulled back, the prone elf grimaces. “<small>darn</small>”, she whispers.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think this is a Wolf Elf, Acris,” Cel says. “...Are there Duck Elves? I think this is a Duck Elf.” </p>
    <p>Body still pointing at Acris, the feathered creature’s head whips around at Cel on it’s long neck.  It makes an incensed hiss.</p>
    <p>“Em’ honker I think’s a goose.  Must be a Goose Elf, weh?”  Acris tries to make arcane looking gestures like he might be about to cast another spell at the interlopers.</p>
    <p>“Huh,” Cel says. “...Do you think they’re afflicted?” She pauses. “Hey, miss Goose Elf, are you afflicted?” </p>
    <p>She stares blankly for a moment, before responding.  Her voice is a bit deeper than expected.  “Yes, I am the Goose type.  There is nothing that should concern you.  I am well.”</p>
    <p>Her accent is extremely thick, but apart from the screwed up sentence structure, she seems to pronounce the words clearly.  The goose, however, makes an irritated honk in her direction.  </p>
    <p>“It actually <i>is</i> true that I am a Goose Elf,” she clarifies.</p>
    <p>Acris squints at her very suspiciously.</p>
    <p>“Mais la, you know Cel,” he stops to stroke the tiny patch of hair on his chin as though he were a Real Wizardtm with a beard.  “I thinks that migh’ be some kinda lie, me.”</p>
    <p>Cel nods. She pulls the self-proclaimed “Goose Elf” to her feet. It takes about twice as much hefting as she expected. “All right, miss Goose Elf -- <i>if that is your real name,</i>” she says, grimacing and rubbing at her arm, “what were you doing sneaking around in this warehouse? I’m pretty sure it’s not birdfood storage, so you must have been up to something fowl.” </p>
    <p>Acris barely suppresses a giggle.</p>
    <p>She looks over to the side, eyes landing on something that had gone unnoticed in the brawl; a small basket filled with a common form of blue riverberry, known for its bitter taste and for how easily it stains.  She looks back to Cel.</p>
    <p>“I,” she starts, then pauses… then continues, “was eating those.” She points at the basket.</p>
    <p>“Weh, non.”  Acris disagrees.  “Noone would eat a whole basket by em’selves.  What were...” he looks slowly from the basket of blue berries to the blue goo on her skin.  “Makin’ yourself look sick?”</p>
    <p>Her brow furrows, and her lips curl, like Acris said something distasteful.  “I am not sick!  Why do you say this?  Do you look sick?”  She shoots Acris an accusatory stare… before realizing that she just said something dumb. </p>
    <p>Cel glances at Acris, and nods to herself. “Nope,” she says. “Don’t think you’re making yourself sick, unless that stuff gives you a rash.” She waves her training sword at some of the blue goo that had washed to the floor. “I don’t think you were eating those berries. I think you were wearing them.” </p>
    <p>She presents the “Goose Elf” a triumphant grin. “And now that we’ve caught you in the act… why were you smearing berries on yourself? ...You might as well come clean now. If you don’t, no matter how tough you are, we can make you quack.” </p>
    <p>She looks confused.  “... I think that is supposed to be pronounced ‘crack’.  Isn’t that how Lowlanders-”</p>
    <p id="i">“<span class="big">HONK</span>”</p>
    <p>“... how... you… would… pronounce that word around here?</p>
    <p>“<small>Kak kak kak,</small>” giggles Acris to himself before he remembers that this is actually an interrogation of a very suspicious possible Wolf Elf spy in a terribly bad attempt at... disguising herself as a regular elf by dying herself blue?</p>
    <p>“Mais, did you really think you’d be able to hide yer grey by makin’ yerself a nice respectable blue with just some berry dye?”</p>
    <p>There is a prolonged, blank-stared pause.</p>
    <p>Several minutes pass.</p>
    <p>Finally:</p>
    <p>“No,” she lies.</p>
    <p>Cel blinks. “...All right, let’s get back on task. Why were you pretending to be a non-Goose Elf? What nefarious deeds were ya up to, huh? Some kind of feather-brained scheme?” She gestures to the goose. “Or is <I>that</i> the egghead behind all this?” </p>
    <p>The Elf continues to just look somewhat confused.  The goose, however, closes its eyes and emits a long-suffering, drawn out honk.  It then honks again, with more emphasis.</p>
    <p>“...That is incorrect.  Please disregard that.  I was just-”</p>
    <p>“Ho<i>nnnk,</i>” the goose insists.</p>
    <p>“I…  To explain, there is…”</p>
    <p>After a few more moments of awkward silence, she hangs her head.</p>
    <p>	“I… wanted to blend in.  To resemble Rivers.  To stay with them.”</p>
    <p>Cel’s smile falters. “For… your nefarious plan to… learn all of their secrets for your Wolf Elf masters?” </p>
    <p>“... I thought I was a Goose elf.”</p>
    <p>“Honk.”</p>
    <p>“I mean no, I am a Goose elf.”</p>
    <p id="i">“Honk.”</p>
    <p>“Yes I am, ignore that.”</p>
    <p>Cel sighs. “Acris, are Goose Elves a thing? That we’re supposed to watch out for and guard against?”</p>
    <p>“Nooooon...” Acris ponders his lessons.  <kbd>There are fourteen different known classifications of elf kind.  The greenest among them is the river elf.  </kbd>“We’re ‘sposed to be watchin’ fer Wolf Elves.  An’ probably Sea Elves, but this’un’s breathin’ air so she ain’t one that’s for shore.”</p>
    <p>He folds his arms and tries to look like someone in a position of authority.</p>
    <p>“Why’re you tryin’ to come stay wi’ us all secret like when you ken jus axe, weh?”</p>
    <p>“I…” she starts,”... wanted to…”</p>
    <p>She pauses again, her eyes looking upward… and then she exhales sharply.</p>
    <p>	“I thought the Rivers would not let me stay with them.  So, I would hide with them.  This was what I had planned.”  Looks like she quacked after all.</p>
    <p>“Mais... Cel, whatchu think bout ‘er?”</p>
    <p>Cel shoves her training sword back into her belt. “Seems all right. Should probably just introduce her to Smilisca or the Litoria, or something, and I bet they’ll be fine with her tagging along. Don’t trust the duck, though.” </p>
    <p>“<i>Honnk</i>”, the goose warns.  Meanwhile, the elf looks flustered.  “The… The Litoria?  No, do not!  If you tell of me, there is no way I will be permitted!  They will tell the Mothers, and then… oh, darn.”  She looks frustrated with herself again.</p>
    <p>Cel squints at the elf. “So your mothers would just tell you no, or what? You could run away or something.” </p>
    <p>The elf squints back at Cel.  “...Is that… what does that mean, to run away?  Run away to where?” </p>
    <p>“You know -- split,” Cel says. “Leave. Scram. Run off to do your own thing. Start over. Live your own life. Go off and adventure. That kind of thing. Then umm… return later, when you’re satisfied. That’s what I’m doing.” </p>
    <p>“Oh.”  She is quiet a moment.  “I… thought that <i>was</i> what I was doing.  Was I doing it incorrectly?  I’m not certain what absconding should be like in the Lowla-” “<i>Hiss</i>” “...Around… here.”</p>
    <p>“Warmaster Litoria’s still on... um...” Acris cuts himself off before he gives away any additional state pseudo-secrets.  “Oarmaster Staurois though!  He ken make sure yer allowed t’stay!  We jus’ gotta sneak you onta the raft an then make chores real good so there’s no chance t’introduce you till af’er we embark!”</p>
    <p>The elf looks to Acris, her eyes widening, either in surprise, or incomprehension.  Whichever it is, she eventually manages; “You… You would help me do this?”</p>
    <p>“If yer for shore not a Wolf Elf spy, weh, we ken mebee help,” Acris answers, suddenly unsure about his ability to really spot a real live Wolf Elf in the fuzz.</p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>Now this is something Acris does know about.  <kbd>River elves are the blood in the Elven body.</kbd>  He’s been listening.</p>
    <p>“A’cause you’re our cousine, an you need the help.  If’n you were in a place t’help us, you’d prolly do the same, weh?”</p>
    <p>The elf considers this wisdom, putting her hand to her chin and everything.  </p>
    <p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>
    <p>After a moment, she reconsiders this stance.</p>
    <p>“Unless you had already come near our home, that is.  Then yes, we’d also bring you in.”</p>
    <p>Cel stares at the elf for a moment, and then shrugs. “Doesn’t really change whether or not we should help you, though, does it?” </p>
    <p>“... I… don’t know?” she guesses.</p>
    <p>“If’n we help you <i>now</i>, you might’a help us <i>later</i> too.”  Acris smiles.  “If yer not gon’ take it from kindness n family duty, then mais take it on a future exchange a’ services.”</p>
    <p>This concept seems to click with her.  She gestures the affirmative.  “I am not sure how I will help you, but I know full well I can make efforts in that direction.  But I’m afraid I am not sure what you intend next.   If the disguise would not work,” she says, gesturing to the berrybasket, “then how will I board without being noticed?”</p>
    <p>“ ‘ts easy enough,” Cel says. “We walk you on board, and then you… don’t leave. Right?”</p>
    <p>“Weh,” Acris agrees, “nobody notices people who are jus’ doin’ their chores like they ‘sposed to.”</p>
    <p>She is quiet for another moment.</p>
    <p>“...While I am… not entirely surprised by that assertion… it is not just the Rivers I am concerned with hiding from.”</p>
    <p>Cel nods. “You’re hiding from your moms, too, right?” she says, sitting down on one of the boxes nearby. “Well, they’re not going on the boats, are they?” </p>
    <p>“I am… uncertain.  It will likely depend on whether the Rivers find their remuneration to be adequate for passage.”  At this point, it seems the goose has accepted that no immediate harm is forthcoming, and lands with a heavy thud and copious flapping on a box next to the elf. </p>
    <p>Cel reaches for her training sword, eyeing the goose carefully. In response, the goose flashes her an expression that is… surprisingly difficult to read, for a waterfowl.  The goose is abstruse.</p>
    <p>“Uh, so, um,” Acris stumbles over his words, “We’re still s’posed to be on watch ri’ now.  Think we ken walk an talk an decide how t’handle all’a this at the same time?  Mais, uh... what’s yer name anyway?”</p>
    <p>“...Oh, I suppose that is only appropriate.  I am known as No-”</p>
    <p>A gruff, deep voice can be heard resonating inside the warehouse, emanating from the entrance the two(presumably, three) youths used.  “-headdam, witless fools!  This is how you get beavers!”</p>
    <p>With a prompt and practiced hand, the heavy stone door of the warehouse is slammed shut, the crossbar dropped to seal it.  Expertly fitted, what little light was filtering in through the cracked door is now extinguished, the only remaining light being the softly glowing stone left sitting on the floor.</p>
    <p>Coincidentally, that, too, expires.</p>
    <p>Seconds pass.</p>
    <p>A sharp ochre light suddenly cuts through the dark warehouse. Cel’s hand glows like a torch. “Well, this is just great,” she says, waving the light over the two other elves and the suspicious bird. “Don’t suppose any of us have a good way to make a big hole in the wall or something, do we?” </p>
    <p>“Non, not fast,” Acris answers quietly.</p>
    <p>Cel frowns. "...Well, we could shout for help." </p>
    <p>Acris eyes the large bird.</p>
    <p>“Maaaais...” his grin is hidden in the dark room, “we could honk for it.”</p>
    <p>“Honk”, the goose rebuts, then turns to stare at No____.  She does not respond, causing the goose to follow up with a more frustrated “Honk.”  She seems to be trying to ignore it.</p>
    <p>“I am not sure if that will be successful: the Onagi built this warehouse thickly of chert.  I… do not think that Goose Elves have any way to shape the stone. Do you have another idea?”  She looks at Acris with curiosity.</p>
    <p>Acris contemplates his available spells.  He can help protect someone from danger just a little bit.  He can make a quantity of water appear anywhere.  And he can fire off rays of frost.  That’s pretty thoroughly his limit for the day.  He shrugs and looks at Cel.  Maybe she can do some kind of cool, but probably not cold, Fire Elf trick?</p>
    <p>Cel frowns. “I could light all this wood on fire. Don’t think that would help, but I totally could, just saying.” </p>
    <p>The partially-named elf frowns, trying to remember something.  “I… think, if I remember correctly, that stone can get weak if made hot… but only if it’s made cool quickly after.  Maybe if there is more water in here…” She glances around the immediate area, but the only water she spots is what is already soaking her.</p>
    <p>“Mais, there too much wood here t’risk startin’ any big big fires.  Last thing we want is to all git burnt up crispy fried... well, almost all anyway...” Acris looks guiltily at his feet.  “Mais la, I ken always git more water.  That ain’t hard.”</p>
    <p>“...But we’re sealed within here.  Where will you get the water from?”</p>
    <p>What Acris wouldn’t give for some Prestidigitation right now.  But no, alas, he does not know the spell to do fun special spell effects.</p>
    <p>“Oh, jus, you know...” he looks at her in the dim light of Cel’s hand-torch, “Magic.”  He wiggles his fingers and tries his very best to look like a real cool Actual Wizard<sup>tm</sup>.</p>
    <p>Cel nods. “Acris is a wizard,” she says, gesturing to the River Elf. “Pretty powerful one, too. He could probably flood this place if he felt like it.” </p>
    <p>Acris blushes a deeper shade of green, but says nothing.</p>
    <p>“So it sounds like our best bet is to pile a bunch of wood against the wall, and then ignite it, and hope it cracks before we die of smoke inhalation,” Cel says. She starts shoving a log against the doorway. “Sound good? Any specific place that would be better to put the fire, or is the doorway good?” </p>
    <p>The new elf chews on her lower lip for a moment.  “I do not know if it sounds good.  I don’t think it does.  It does sound like the best way to carry out a plan of that type.  Doorways are much more vulnerable to damage.” </p>
    <p>“Sounds like a plan then!” Cel says. She gives the log another shove, managing it another inch doorward. “Might want to give me a hand though, then,” she says. “This thing’s heavy.” </p>
    <p>"M' not sure 'bout this," Acris scratches his head, "Are you sure we can't just honk for help?" </p>
    <p>No-something responds with disappointed tones.  “I do not think it would succeed… But if it were to succeed, most likely we would be heard by one of the Samra.  Without a disguise, It seems most certain that I would be discovered, and returned to the Mothers.” </p>
    <p>"An we got no other ideas?" Acris shakes his head sadly. "I guess we could just wait fer somewhat to come find us, weh? Ain't like they're gonna jus leave this stuff t'rot."</p>
    <p>“How long do you think that would be?” Cel says. Acris turns to look at No___ with a curious look.</p>
    <p>The drenched elf looks between the two other elves for a moment, before looking down at the floor.  “...Probably before days end.  This lumber is doubtlessly destined for Eparchy,” she says, melancholy in her voice.</p>
    <p>Cel blinks. “Oh. Pffft!” She shoves the log back over to the pile. “You had me scared there, No Goose,” she continues. “Thought we were going to be stuck in here period or something. Trapped forever in an unused warehouse until some other kids, centuries from now, shove the doors open to find our skeletons still scratching at the doorway. ...What’s an Eparchy, anyway?” </p>
    <p>The elf with ‘No’ name’s eyes widen for a moment, as another careless detail has been given away.  She hems and haws.  </p>
    <p>“...It’s… a… thing, that I know about, because…”  She stops.  The Goose makes an exasperated hiss.  </p>
    <p>“...You see, Goose elve-”</p>
    <p>The Goose flaps to a nearby crate and headbutts her, following with a warbling tirade.</p>
    <p>After a few more moments of silence, the somewhat-known elf relents.</p>
    <p>“I… may not have been entirely honest with you,” she says, deadpan. </p>
    <p>Cel nods. “‘Ts okay,” she says, waving it off. “I was pretty sure Goose Elves weren’t a thing anyway, ‘cause we’d end up with too many bird-themed elves, and that would just start to get weird. Also, ‘cause I’m pretty sure the Crag Elves would have chased out any other elves that showed up around here.” </p>
    <p>“I do not know whether Goose Elves are a thing or not, but you are correct; the Crag are very careful with their isolation.  The reason I know this, and so much more… is because I am a Crag.  I know I may not fully seem so, but that is a consequence of my… nature.”</p>
    <p>The goose rubs its head against her shoulder, then cocks its head at her.</p>
    <p>“...and this is Gander. Though he may have helped me pass as a Goose Elf, he is not a normal cragoose, but rather a physical manifestation of the vital essence that permeates and sustains all living beings.”</p>
    <p id="i">“Honk.”</p>
    <p>“...And he is <i>most emphatically</i> not a duck,” she concludes, looking at Cel with an apologetic expression.</p>
    <p>“Well, if he’s a manifestation of a ghostly essence, he ain’t much of a goose either,” Cel says. “Pretty sure I’m not permeated or sustained by geese. Except maybe when I’m eating them or something.” </p>
    <p>Gander doesn’t seem to be overly perturbed by casual mention of fowl consumption.  It seems he has something else on his bird-brain; looking towards one of the far walls, and then poking No- with his beak.  She seems to be getting more flustered with each poke, but most of her attention seems to be on the other two elves; Acris, in particular, is met with a cautious expression.</p>
    <p>"Mais..." Acris observes the not-goose carefully.  "What is your name anyway? I don't think we caught it, me."</p>
    <p>“Oh, yes.  I am <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SB4N6jbBH_TiEL4RlDsprRlh7hCA0qzAnLbqJW6mbzM/edit?usp=sharing">Nobody</a>,” she says, matter-of-factly.</p>
    <p>"Nobody? <i>That's</i> the name they stuck you wi, weh?" Acris looks very confused.</p>
    <p>“Yes.  It is a name of some significance.  In our language, it means ‘one who is not’, or ‘one who is free of consequential nature.’ “</p>
    <p>Cel nodded appreciatively. “So your name means you’re not forced to do anything?” </p>
    <p>Nobody looks at Cel with a surprised look on her face.  “... I… have often thought to myself that that would be a desired interpretation.“</p>
    <p>“But its not?” Cel said, frowning. “The interpretation they use, I mean. Your moms, or whoever.” </p>
    <p>“The other Mothers,” Nobody corrects. “Were not the ones to name me.  But it is likely the intent behind the name was a hope that my life would be a peaceful one, unburdened by significance.  It is a somewhat comforting thought,” she admits unconvincingly.  A curious look then crosses your face.  “Your name… I believe I heard you referred to as Cel?  What meaning is there to this name?”</p>
    <p>	The goose continues shoulder baps, intensity increasing over time.  One might think of geese as impatient.  Gander, however, has mastered the ability to be patiently impatient. </p>
    <p>Cel leans back against a stack of logs. “My name’s actually Celosia,” she says. “Celosia Elderbrand, technically; I just go by Cel because its short. Celosias are a type of flower or something, but I’ve never seen one, so I couldn’t tell you about it.” </p>
    <p>Nobody blinks rapidly.  A smile threatens to cross her face.  “Elderbrand? Did I hear correctly?  You have a Bloodname, at your age… but it’s <i>Elderbrand</i>?”</p>
    <p>Cel cocks her head sideways. “...Yeah?” </p>
    <p>“It’s just…” Nobody makes a small, choking noise, “... in my language, such a name would translate to ‘To burn the aged with hot irons’.  It’s… humorous.”</p>
    <p>“Well, I got it from my parents,” the Fire Elf replies, crossing her arms and turning back to the door. “So I guess burning the elderly is a family tradition or somethin’. Very important work, I’d bet. Respectable. Not funny in the slightest.”  </p>
    <p>The smile warning on Nobody’s face degrades to a smile watch, largely displaced by a front of confusion.  “... I apologize if I have caused insult.  I am certain it is just a coincidence of language.”  Eager to cover up her perceived faux-pas, she turns to Acris as the goosebumps once more pick up in frequency.  “And a name of Acris?  I am not familiar with any such meaning, nor any word near it…”</p>
    <p>Acris smiles happily.  This is something he can hopefully shed some light on.</p>
    <p>“M’name’s really Acris Hylidae.  M’family’s the Hylidaes, we got’s t’name one’a the largest categories of frogs - t’Tree Frogs, sometimes also called Leaf Frogs.”  He looks around at nobody in particular.  “It were on account’a our large numbers a’cousins, it were.”  He ends the statement somewhat deflated and less happy than he started it.</p>
    <p>“Why frogs, though?” Cel says. “Nothing wrong with them, mind, but I’d have named some alligators or something.” </p>
    <p>“Frogs is everywhere though!” Acris explains, “We didn’t have gators on t’other side, jus’ crocs.  An’ frogs is nicer.”</p>
    <p>Nobody seems somewhat starstruck.  “You… also have a Bloodname?  Ancestors preserve… you must be great heroes among your people, to be so worthy so quickly.  How did you-”</p>
    <p>At this juncture, Gander escalates from goosebumps to a proven attention getting method, biting Nobody directly on the ear.</p>
    <p>“-unnnnNG!  Okay! I get it!”  She sighs.  “We… may not actually be constrained in here.  I have a way to extricate us… as Gander is insistent I point out.”</p>
    <p>Acris looks to the Crag elf expectantly.  He’s hoping it involves something really neat.  Like magic.</p>
    <p>Nobody meets Acris’ expectant gaze, then puffs herself up, trying to appear confident.  “Our ancestors sought the strength of stone, making it a part of themselves, and themselves a part of the stone.  It allows those of us of sufficient will to speak to the stone, hear its whispers… and, for some, to even ask it to move.  It is a technique that we are not supposed to reveal to otherelves… but to heroes like you, I doubt it will be anything of significant import.”  She gestures to one of the flat walls nearby.  “I… believe I may be able to will a passage large enough to accommodate you.”</p>
    <p>“So… you’re a wizard, too, then?” Cel says, glancing between Nobody and Acris. “Anyway, yeah, do it. I wanna see.” </p>
    <p>Gesturing the affirmative, Nobody slowly walks over to one of the walls, about midway between the doors set on either side.  She places her hand on the stone wall, and closes her eyes.  Her face scrunches in concentration.  Sweat beads on her forehead… or maybe that’s still left over from the several gallons of water that were dumped on her.</p>
    <p>However, eventually, there is a low, trembling grinding noise.  Near the floor, a flap of stone curls away, revealing the dirt outside.  Eventually, however, the stone stops moving, and Nobody takes in a gasp of air.</p>
    <p>The hole is… somewhat unimpressive.  3 feet wide, 3 ½ tall;  Acris and Cel can probably squeeze through.</p>
    <p>“That was <i>awesome!</i>”  Acris is very much impressed.  “Holy mudpuddles that was really just the most awesome thing!”  He scoots through the hole to see the other side of it.  It’s not really a squeeze so much as a duck.  Acris is less than 3 feet wide.</p>
    <p>Cel ducks her head into the hole after him, tracing her fingers over the inside rim of the hole. “Are you gonna be able to put it back afterwards?” she says, shoving a leg through. </p>
    <p>Nobody’s face unscrunches.  She sounds tired when she speaks. “No.  There are some Crag who possess enough potence to will many times, but… I’m afraid I am not one of them.”</p>
    <p>Gander, nodding in satisfaction (or maybe irritation?  What is goose gestures?), then waddles away into the dark, objective uncertain.</p>
    <p>Acris helpfully detours to go open the proper door for the lady elf, so she does not have to stoop to exit.</p>
    <p>Nobody had been looking at the small hole with a defeated expression, and is caught off-guard by Acris’ obvious solution.  However, she approaches the open door cautiously, looking around outside for any other elves.  “...Is the way clear?  Or… is there even somewhere to abscond to?” she asks, hesitantly.</p>
    <p>Acris looks around carefully, but all that time debating what to do has brought them straight through to lunchtime and this area is deserted.</p>
    <p>"Why don't you come on wit us so we ken git a meal?" He offers helpfully.</p>
    <p>Cel nods. “There’s not gonna be anybody else around here for a bit,” she says, still tracing her hands over the smooth, shaped stone flap. She climbs back out, and wanders to the front door. “We’ll get some food, and then come back here and get back on watch for a bit.” </p>
    <p>Nobody looks uncertain at the teen elves’ casual suggestions of dereliction, but ultimately defers to their wisdom; they are heroes, after all.  With one last furtive look around, she pulls her still damp cloak tightly around herself, draping the hood over her head and following Acris as best she can.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Gander emerges from the hole with a rope carried in his beak, the far end remaining somewhere in the warehouse.  He drops the carried end at Cel’s feet, and then stares up at her.</p>
    <p>Cel kicks the rope into the air, and grabs it with unnecessary drama. “What, am I supposed to tie you up with it so it looks like you couldn’t stop her?” she says, staring right back. </p>
    <p>Gander gives Cel an incredulous(?) look.  Then, slowly, as though to a child, he demonstrates the obvious by tugging on a piece of the rope still in reach.</p>
    <p>“That looks like a yes,” Cel says. “I don’t think anyone’s gonna buy it, though. You’re kind of a duck.” She gives the rope a hard pull, wrapping an end of it around her elbow. “Seriously, what’s with the rope?” </p>
    <p>Cel’s tug on the rope is accompanied by a small scraping noise from inside the warehouse; based on the resistance she gets, there’s definitely something big-ish but not too heavy on the other end of the rope.  Gander narrows his eyes at Cel, but then gives the rope a few more encouraging tugs. </p>
    <p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m pulling it, bird,” the elf replies, grabbing the line with both hands and hauling it over her shoulder. “Keep your feathers on.” </p>
    <p>It takes a little bit of work, but once Cel gets going, it doesn’t take long before there is a thunk from the hole and the rope pulls taut.  Looking back at the hole, Cel can see that it is now blocked by a large crate; the rope seems to terminate in a stone hook that is currently, well, hooked into a woven loop tied onto the crate.</p>
    <p>Hole blocked, Gander waddles over to the crate, and using all of his fowl power, hefts the hook free, before dragging it back over to Cel. Again, he looks at her expectantly.</p>
    <p>“Have you considered <i>writing down</i> what you’re trying to say, duck?” Cel says. “Or maybe writing something in ectoplasm, since you’re apparently some kind of spooky essence ghost? This is getting ridiculous.” She sighs, and crouches down to pick up the hook. “What is it you’re trying to tell me? Am I supposed to pull that chest out of the wall or something? Is it full of bread? I think geese like bread.” </p>
    <p>At once more being called a duck, Gander begins to extend his wings, making a low warbling noise that sounds kind of like a growl.   However, he gets ahold of himself.  Slowly, patiently, he gets his beak around the stone hook and lifts it with all his goosely might.  He holds it aloft, up at Cel…  before unceremoniously dropping it on her foot.</p>
    <p>He then gets a head start on the goose chase, waddling at top speed towards Nobody.  For her part, she is currently clutching the thick cloak around herself and hunching over, trying to not look quite so tall… not easy, in the current company she keeps. </p>
    <p>“Ow!” Cel says, clutching at her foot. She turns a glare at the retreating bird’s back. “Pretty bold there, birdbrain,” she says. She grabs the hook and rope, and shoves both back into the hole, hooking them into the wicker handle on the crate. </p>
    <p>"Oh mais that good thinking that is, weh." Acris grins at Cel and Gander. "Makes it lot harder t'see th' hole."</p>
    <p>Cel grumbles to herself, before turning back towards the hunched Crag Elf. “Hey, Nobody, is there anyone around here that might be able to work on repairing a sword? Mine is kind of messy.” </p>
    <p>“A sword? It’s possible…” She makes another furtive look around.  “...perhaps it would be wisest if I were to observe it first.  If it is but a kuthe…” she trails off, obviously distracted.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what that is,” Cel says, “but sure.” She slides her Lycan sword out of its scabbard, keeping the tip pointed down, and holds it up so that Nobody can see it. “Acris and I recovered it from a lost Lycan armory, deep underground.” </p>
    <p>For a moment, Nobody seems mesmerised by the appearance of the sword.  Her eyes run up and down it’s form, equal parts excitement and trepidation.  Then, she remembers herself, and once more looks around.  She turns to Cel.</p>
    <p>“...So much metal…  It is unusual, but I may see what can be done.  But, please, I must ask of you; if you know of a place in which to seclude me, please, lead me to it.  Until then, I cannot assist with this matter.” </p>
    <p>“Weh!”  Acris enthusiastically gestures for the two to follow him.  “Master Nonc will be busy, we ken hide you on the raft!”</p>
    <p>Nobody follows enthusiastically, while Gander does his best to keep up.  While he may flap his wings energetically, it becomes quickly obvious that flight is not quite as easy for him as it is for most other geese… at least, any geese seen around these parts.</p>
    <p>Cel slips the sword back into its sheath, and follows. </p>
    <p>When they reach the flotilla, it is as Acris had suggested, busily paused for lunch. While no real work is getting done, river elves are still moving about, either heading to and from their home rafts for the meal or waiting in the lines at the fisherelves rafts to pick up something already prepared. Partager being configured for construction work means there are more specialized rafts without mass food storage or large scale preparation space than there are rafts with useful mechanical devices such as cargo lifts and cranes.</p>
    <p>It doesn't really take much effort for the trio to make it to the Navigator's raft, though Acris does stop to wave hello to a mostly-submerged elf watching their progress from the river. He happily introduces Nobody to the family turtle, and shows her around the two-room houseboat. The front room, on the prow, is designed as a workroom, a kitchen, and has damp storage space in trap doors under the floor.  The back room has sleeping space and dry storage in trap doors under the floor.</p>
    <p>Tour complete, Acris gestures with wide open arms.</p>
    <p>"So this is it!" He exclaims excitedly, "We ken hide you in here! Jus grab a hammock an pretend t'be a pile o'blankets!"</p>
    <p>Nobody’s expression throughout the entire tour is one of wonderment and awe; it is clear she is overwhelmed by all the new sights and sensations.  She doesn’t say a word, not even when introduced to the family turtle, although it seems Gander comes to a rapid understanding with same. Finally, once within the confines of the houseboat, she finally has an opportunity to recover… and to shuck off her still-somewhat-damp cloak.  As she does so, it becomes quickly evident that the cloak may not have been as thick as previously thought.  </p>
    <p>The best way to describe Nobody, now that she is no longer largely concealed by the cloak, is ‘stocky’.  This is because, by general unspoken rule, elves cannot be ‘fat’.  Her simple robe is dyed a drab brown, and a plain, uncolored linen sash completes her simple ensemble.  She folds up the damp cloak with practiced ease, setting it aside before clasping Acris’ hands together with her own.  She stares down into his eyes.  “Noble Acris, I thank you dearly for what you have done for me this day.  Though it was my intention to find myself in such exotic, mesmerizing environs, I never imagined that I would do so by the hand of one so honored.  You… both of you… have my eternal gratitude.  I believe I may spend the whole of my life seeking to be worthy of this distinction you have visited upon me.”  Though she tries to conceal it, her words are steeped with emotion.  She continues to clasp Acris’ hands, far longer than is typically acceptable.</p>
    <p>Acris blinks in rapid succession before blushing a very deep shade of green.  He gains control of his shipwrecked barge of thoughts before the hand-holding continues too much longer.  Keep it together, Acris, your heart belongs to a different Crag elf, after all.</p>
    <p>“<small>I don’t deserve it, non.</small>” Acris mumbles something to himself and then gives Nobody a friendly pat on the back.  “What’re cousins for, weh?”</p>
    <p>Nobody shifts back to her default expression; partially concealed profound confusion.  “I… don’t know.  But hopefully, thanks to you, I will find out.”</p>
    <p>With that, she turns to Cel.  “As promised, I can see what can be done for your… weapon.  May I hold it?” </p>
    <p>Cel nods, sliding the blade back out and handing it hilt-first to Nobody.</p>
    <p>Nobody grabs the sword gingerly, clearly uncertain about the best way to hold it.  Slowly, she sinks to her knees, laying the blade across her lap, and closing her eyes.</p>
    <p>“...What I have been taught… is that all things have a memory of their shape.  Some things have long memories, some short, but of them all, it is mineral which has the longest of all.  I will see if I can speak to the memories… and see if it can be convinced to return to its previous form…”</p>
    <p>She concentrates on the blade.  A small glow settles upon it as she focuses, strain clear on her face.  However, when she finally gives out a small gasp, there is no observable difference in the blade.  </p>
    <p>“Too much metal,” she gasps.  “Stubborn.  Certain.  It changes only under the strongest influence. I’m sorry.”   She starts to hand it back… when a thought crosses her mind.  Her eyes dance across the hilt, the unwoven grip, the loose pommel.</p>
    <p>“...But leather… wood…  These things remember what it was to move.  To live.  To change and grow.  Perhaps…”</p>
    <p>She tries once more, focusing her efforts upon the damaged grip.  At first, nothing happens… but then, a few of the leather wraps begin to coil in on eachother.  Slowly, surely, they weave themselves back around the wooden grip, tightening with each pass.  When Nobody has finished, the hilt is… not <i>repaired</i>, per se, but looks more… complete, than it did before.  Exhausted, Nobody wordlessly returns the weapon to Cel… holding it incorrectly, to boot.</p>
    <p>Cel smiles, not caring a bit that Nobody is literally pointing it at her. “You… you fixed it!” she says. “Least a bit! Thank you!” She grabs the sword by the blade, and pulls the hilt up to her face. “It’s not gonna fall off now, for certain. I’ll still have to see ‘bout the blade… maybe Ehra will give me an extension…”</p>
    <p>She slips the sword back into its scabbard, and gives Nobody a quick bow. “How can I repay you for it? Got someone’s toes you want stomped? Maybe a bit of a lesson on manners for your gander?” </p>
    <p>Gander gives Cel a haughty look, but does not object… after all, he is, technically, a gander also.  As for Nobody, though tired, she looks around the houseboat, her eyes widening with curiosity once more.  </p>
    <p>“I think,” she says slowly, “that you have already repaid me greatly more than enough in balance.”</p>
