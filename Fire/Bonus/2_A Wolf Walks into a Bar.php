    <h1> A Wolf Walks into a Bar</h1> 
<p>“What’ll it be, stranger?”</p>
<p>“Your best mug of spiced wine,” I said, shoving a little gravel into my voice. I kept my eyes on the wall fresco just above his head, and leaned back on one arm, trying to put out a nice aura of diffidence and self-importance. “From your Lycan stocks, good innkeep. Only the bes--”</p>
<p>“Ah, its you, Barry,” the innkeep replied.</p>
<p>I slumped back on the lounge I was sitting at. “Titan’s teats, Tallflower,” I said. “How do you always know its me?”</p>
<p>Tallflower the innkeeper tapped his forehead. “A good bard knows his subjects,” he said. “And you’re the only elf I know who likes the expensive wolf-swill.”</p>
<p>He turned, and swept back to the stock bar.</p>
<p>“Make sure its Halfcock’s at least!” I shouted, startling patrons in a three-table radius.</p>
<p><i>The Howl</i> -- Surt’s newest and only inn -- was packed like a barrel of figs; dozens of elves, from fancy merchantlings to hard-beaten laborers, were crowded together between the inn’s stucco-lined walls. They lounged across its lounge-chairs, stood in packs amid its pathways, hovered around the musicians on its stage, and sat on -- or in several cases, danced on top of -- its scattered tables. Their glow was bright enough to overwhelm the Howl’s torches and table-braziers, casting the room in a vibrant red and yellow pattern that only added to the celebratory atmosphere.</p>
<p>To me, it felt a little forced. </p>
<p>The nervous glances my outburst received from my neighbors didn’t help.</p>
<p>Tallflower plopped a jug of wine and an empty mug onto the table to my right, and a plateful of saltpork-and-fig skewers beside them. “Happy birthday.”</p>
<p>I blinked. “Thanks, Tallflower! You didn--”</p>
<p>“That’ll be eleven marks.”</p>
<p>“--n’t have to be such a moneygrubbing robber-baron, but you work so hard to be one anyway.” I glared at him. “It means a lot.”</p>
<p>He grinned. “I’ve got a business to run, Barry. This inn isn’t cheap.” He rubbed at a bit of charcoal dust stuck to his filigree’d tunic. “And Halfcock’s a rare commodity these days; I’ve only got a few jars left. And maybe a cask of the knockoff stuff.”</p>
<p>I ran a finger over the bottle’s label: a jaunty werechicken in a loincloth. I poured myself a mugfull. “Well, I’m glad to hear that the inn I bought you is successful.”</p>
<p>“And thank you so much for the inspiration,” he chuckled. “You know, its been a bit since we’ve had a good drinking song. I could sing a few bars, see if the crowd gets into it. Maybe get you a fiddle so you can play the solos.”</p>
<p>“No, no, and fuck no.”</p>
<p>Tallflower shrugged. “Suit yourself.”</p>
<p>He dropped butt-first onto the edge of my table, tilting it ever so slightly downward, and nearly sending my saltpork-figs rolling to the floor. Tallflower had been hefty even before he bought the tavern -- not that it ever slowed him down. “Why the long face, though?” he asked. “And I don’t just mean your sour grapes.”</p>
<p>“I just wanted a quiet drink on my birthday.”</p>
<p>“In the only tavern in town, in the first month its open?”</p>
<p>I scrunched my hat a little further onto my head. “Hiding in a crowd is easy. And thanks to Tsun’s little speech, the streets will probably be… exciting tonight. I want festivities that look a bit less like lynchings, thank you.”</p>
<p>Tallflower nodded. “So you’re thinking if something’s going to happen, it’ll start here.”</p>
<p>A few beads of sweat suddenly popped up on my forehead. I scrunched my hat down further. “Well--”</p>
<p>“So to get the drop on them, you disguised yourself as an unfashionable clothes merchant.”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>Tallflower glanced down. “Or an ugly-stick salesman, I guess.”</p>
<p>I sighed. “The hat only has so many designs in it. My choice of attire is limited -- and anyway--”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, your expensive fancy hat that doesn’t work.” He slid back off the table, sending a splash of Halfcock’s out of my mug and to the concrete slab floor. “I’ve got to get back to the bar before the customers get funny ideas. You’ll keep an eye on things, right? Take care of that nonsense if it makes its way in here?”</p>
<p>Phobos Tallflower had been my friend for several decades now -- from back when we were just two dumb kids, fiddling street gigs in Mispelham. But I never did care for the looks he would give me at times like this. Looks that started just after the Conflagration, and hadn’t really let up since. Not desperate, or pleading, just… expectant. </p>
<p>But he was never as bad as most of the people who… expected at me like that. And to be honest, I always did enjoy the attention.</p>
<p>“Fear not, innkeep”, I said, sliding into a roguish grin. I’d practiced it for so long it was practically a mask. “Any ruffian who missteps in here will find my blade at their heart and my boot on their butt.”</p>
<p>“You’re a goddamn hero, Barry. I’ll be back in a few.” And with that, he hustled back towards the bar.</p>
<p>I propped up a skewer over the table’s cooking brazier, and leaned back in my lounge-chair. </p>
<p>I’d only been dozing for a couple of seconds when an ass slammed into my stomach.</p>
<p>Most stories depict the moment the hero or heroine meets the ‘damsel in distress’ (whether that damsel is male, female, neither, whatever -- damsel is a gender-neutral term as far as I’m concerned) as a romantic affair -- eyes meeting, risque attire, lots of innuendo, butterflies in the stomach, etc etc. They rarely mention anything about tons of bricks in your stomach, or describe your breath as being not so much “taken away” as “forced out like a bellows”. And they certainly never mention the elbow to the nose.</p>
<p>I spent a good six seconds trying to remember how to breathe as my assailant scrambled off of me, knocking my hat off from over my eyes in the process. I got a good look at her back as she stood up. She was tall, with defined muscles, and in a single-shouldered wool chiton the color of aged copper; a leather bag and short work-hammer dangled from her belt. </p>
<p>Facing her were a set of four elves in roughspun laborer’s garb, with the number twenty-one haphazardly burned into their tunics. A fifth, somewhat younger possible assailant wobbled behind them; his clothes were of a fancier cut, common to those of merchant families. And all five had a loop of ash pressed into their forehead.</p>
<p>The “ash halo” or “circlet of ash” or whatever (I preferred “ashhat”) had been a popular marking for the really devout members of the “Ashen”, a pile of factions claiming to one degree or another to have “inherited” the pain of the Conflagration, physically and mentally. Most of them were fairly reasonable, though they were all obsessed, and many of them remained as angry, vitriolic, and above all self-righteous as they had since the start of the Liberation. Pain clung to them like… ash. And they often left trails of it in their wake.</p>
<p>“Make this easy, bitch,” the Ashen to the middle-right said, almost gently. She had a scar on her chin that looked surprisingly like a burn. “We’re just gonna have a little talk outside.”</p>
<p>An inauspicious opening, sure, but it could easily have been some sort of personal scuffle. I resolved right then to stay out of it. With my eyes half-closed, lounging, and a bottle of good wine on my table, there was no one way could mistake me for anything but some uninvolved drunk.</p>
<p>The Ashen to Scar’s right moved to circle around my ass-sailant. “No need to make a scene,” he said, barely audible over the nervously receding crowd. “We just want to…” He froze, his eyes suddenly fixed on my face.</p>
<p>Of course, I had forgotten exactly how much my “completely normal Fire Elf” disguise relied on my fancy hat.</p>
<p>Scar blinked. “Is that--”</p>
<p>“Nothing for it, then,” I muttered. I glanced around for my hat, and found it hanging jauntily from the top of my wine bottle. “Jaunty it is.”</p>
<p>I rolled to my feet, grabbing my cap as I went, and finished with a neat bow towards the woman in green, with my eyes locked on Scar’s. I shoved my cheekiest grin onto my face, and forced myself into character.</p>
<p>"Barrabus Leafstorm, somewhat drunk,” I said. A bit of a lie, as I hadn’t even touched the wine yet, but acting a little tipsy always seemed to add to the performance.</p>
<p>All four ashhats took a step back. The Howl’s crowded roar dropped to a murmur.</p>
<p>I scooped a skewer with my free hand, and then swept into right-Ashen’s personal space, stopping with my head a few inches from his chin. I pointed the skewer at Scar. “So, what terrible infraction pushes the Ashen into action?”</p>
<p>Ashen-right stumbled backward. “Evening, sir, just--”</p>
<p>“Nothing of your concern,” Scar said. “We’re just following up on a lead.”</p>
<p>“A lead?” I laughed. “I’m sorry, I took you for a gang of lynch-happy vigilantes! I had no idea you are sleuths as well!”</p>
<p>Rightie coughed. “We’re not, erm, vigilantes, yer lordship,” he said -- referring to me by my “title”, the would-be noble rank a few ‘friendly’ merchants were pushing on me all over Surt. “We’re official. Civile Praesidium, unit twenty-one.”</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“What’s civil about shoving people over in the middle of the bloody tavern?” Greendress said, pushing herself through the crowd that was starting to gather around our merry band of would-be vigilantes. Her jaw was sharp and angular, combining with her high cheekbones to give her face a leonine or lupine cast, framed by charcoal-brown hair that whitened at the tips. </p>
<p>All four Ashen visibly tensed. “No hard feelings, miss,” Rightie said, glancing back and forth between Greendress and myself. “But we’ll need ya to come outside with us for a few minutes. We just need you to help us out with a few questions.”</p>
<p>Scar took a step forward; I sidestepped left to match.  </p>
<p>Greendress stepped up just behind me. “And I suppose your “civil protection” unit is so new your uniforms haven’t come in yet? Or are you just undercover as a bad bjargknottr team?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t caught up on the news, have you, bitch?” Scar said, smiling. “The Ashbringer got us all signed up and organized this morning. Lots and lots of average burners like us, keeping our eyes out for people like you scouting out our turf.”</p>
<p>This was news to me, and did not sound like something the Triumvirate would agree to. It was enough of a surprise to me that I almost missed the other connotation to her statement -- and almost dropped my cheeky grin once I caught it.</p>
<p>I glanced back at Greendress. Her eyes were a clear emperor yellow -- standing out from her fiery goldenrod skin, but together with her jawline, and the strong incisors barely visible when she spoke, they formed a slight suggestion of distant Lycan ancestry. </p>
<p>Just enough that in a dark tavern, a bunch of ignorant ashhats would think they’d found a werewolf.</p>
<p>And the last thing I wanted was to spend my birthday explaining racism and unbiased justice systems to a bunch of violent fuckwits at a bar. “And what authority--”</p>
<p>“What the burning hells did you call me?” Greendress said, one hand on the hammer at her hip, and the other shoving me less-than-gently out of the way.</p>
<p>I could practically feel my old dance mentor screaming at me for the terrible pirouette that helped me recover from her shove, but it would hardly due for ‘the Phoenix Lord’ to topple over from a slight push. Still, at this point I’d had enough; this “Civile Praesidium” thing was new to me, and at the time did not sound legitimate in the slightest, but Greendress wasn’t asking for my help, and I hadn’t even touched the wine yet, so I wasn’t nearly drunk enough to play mediator. </p>
<p>Still, ‘the Phoenix Lord’ being seen sneaking out of an ‘injustice’ that was clearly about to turn into a fight wouldn’t do positive things for my image. And the crowd encircling our merry band had only gotten thicker -- to the point where I could see Tallflower at the far back, struggling in vain to push his way through.</p>
<p>What I needed was a distraction. </p>
<p>I scanned the crowd for a likely subject, and picked out a burly elf in a stained tartan tunic, with thick leather bracers wrapped around her arms. She was perfect for the job, but would need incentive -- and judging by the generous wobble in her stance, I guessed that she wasn’t in much of a state of mind for coin.</p>
<p>My eyes fell on the jug of Halfcock's. </p>
<p>I caught Tallflower’s eye, and gave him a sad shrug, before grabbing the wine jug and filling my mug up to the brim -- it would be a shame to waste all of it, after all. I then sauntered over to my subject and handed her the bottle. “Here, my dear,” I said. “This place needs more excitement. Start a bar fight for me.”</p>
<p>The brute grinned. “Hell, yeah!” She turned and smashed the bottle hard against a nearby lounge, so the bottom sheared off in a spray of glass and wine. “BAR FIGHT!”</p>
<p>"Not exactly what I had in mind," I muttered sadly, as my temporary accomplice clotheslined several nearby drinkers. "But it'll do." </p>
<p>I swung back towards my table, ducking under a surfeit of glowing limbs as the Howl erupted into the Brawl. Greendress and Scar were actively shouting at each other, sparks literally flying between them, while Rightie and the other two Ashen were trying to get behind Greendress without stepping into the conflagration of violence now surrounding them. No reason to make this easy for them -- after all, they cost me wine. </p>
<p>I slipped back into the crowd and maneuvered through until I was behind the Ashhat trio. To my surprise, they still seemed more interested in apprehension than assault, though whether that was because of a genuine interest in justice, or because they were apprehensive about enraging their “Lycan” target, was beyond me. Still, none of them had drawn weapons, and all three were focused on Greendress rather than watching the crowd.</p>
<p>I ducked under a beer-splattered table, grabbing an empty mug as I went past, and dropped my foot just in front of the rearmost Ashen’s leg. He tripped, catching himself with both hands on the table’s edge, just before he could topple into a huddle of seven laborers, who were watching the rest of the brawl with obvious amusement. I slipped back out from under the table; a kick to his rear sent the Ashen headfirst into the huddle.</p>
<p>The second seemed surprised when I tapped her on the shoulder, and even more so when I shoved the mug into her hands. </p>
<p>"Hold this for me," I said.</p>
<p>The elf blinked, and then shoved it back to me. "No way!"</p>
<p>"Come now, my lady," I said smoothly, slipping it back into her hands.</p>
<p>"I ain't falling for that," she said quickly. "You're Barrabus Leafstorm, and that means this is some kinda distraction whereupon I get hit with something while I'm arguing… with you…"</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>The Ashen ducked -- just in time for her compatriot to get chucked out of the laborer-pile and land bodily on the shoulders of the savvy Ashen in front of me. I stepped over both, giving the laborers a quick wave as they dived towards the fallen Ashen.</p>
<p>Rightie had made it behind Greendress. A pair of shackles dangled from his hand, and he was nodding rapidly to Scar from behind Greendress’ back, as if asking for her to signal when he could go in for a grab. Scar, for her part, wasn’t even paying attention -- instead, she was fixated on glaring Greendress in the face, as if hoping to make her back down on sheer willpower alone. Greendress wasn’t budging.</p>
<p>My table sat just to their right, my mug of wine sitting untouched atop it.</p>
<p>The crowd around the Ashens’ scuffle had generally scattered into smaller scuffles of their own, but there were enough pockets of people nearby that I was fairly certain I could make it to my table without being noticed -- and once there, I could grab my mug, shove a few figs in my mouth, and be out of the Howl well before anyone realized I’d left. Leaving Greendress to be arrested would be unfortunate, but I was certain that would fizzle as soon as both Ashen realized it was now just the two of them against a “werewolf”. And I’d finally get a chance to enjoy my birthday.</p>
<p>I wove into a wave of wounded workers, who were using the table grates to ‘cook off’ cuts and bruises, and cut back out at my table’s edge.</p>
<p>My fig skewers were long gone -- grabbed up by hungry partiers, or scattered to the floor.</p>
<p>I shook my head sadly, and reached across the table for my mug.</p>
<p>“Barrabus Leafstorm!”</p>
<p>“Oh come on!” I muttered. I turned back around. </p>
<p>Greendress and Scar had stopped their argument, and were now staring at Rightie, who had turned to face me, a hopeful expression on his face. “I hereby deputize you in the service of the Civilie Praesidium!”</p>
<p>For a moment, I was struck dumb by the sheer chutzpah of this elf before me. The thought that he would try enlist my aid after he and his three compatriots barged into the inn as if they owned the place, racially profiled an innocent elf they happened to find there, threw her at me, and caused a bar fight, all because they happened to find someone with a vaguely wolflike face…</p>
<p>Which was strange. The Howl was quite crowded; it would have been hard to just randomly spot a single face amidst this crowd.</p>
<p>And then realization dawned. There were FIVE Ashen.</p>
<p>I gave the tavern a quick scan to satisfy my theory, and then turned back to Rightie, presenting the fakest, cheesiest smug grin I could muster. “There’s no need, sirrah,” I replied. “Your suspect is innocent.”</p>
<p>I swept over to Scar, keeping my eyes off her angry glare and on the burnt twenty-one in her tunic. “Judging from your uniforms, I deduced you are a relatively new unit -- probably crammed together from other militias. You’ve met the other members of your team before, but don’t necessarily know them personally.”</p>
<p>“That’s… correct,” Scar begrudged. “But we’re a good team. Every one of us is a patriot. If you’re--”</p>
<p>“Every one of you here, yes?” I said. “I notice that one of you is conspicuously absent. And, in fact, left almost as soon as you cornered miss…”</p>
<p>“Matilda,” Greendress said. She seemed a good bit more calm now that the attention was on me.</p>
<p>“You work at a Bronzesmith’s, yes?”</p>
<p>“I’m one of the best in the city, you mean,” she replied. “The shop isn’t mine, though, if that’s what this is about.”</p>
<p>“I do believe it is,” I said. “Can you think of any reason why a merchant’s son would want you harmed?”</p>
<p>Matilda frowned. “Not really… I’m in good with our suppliers… and Pontius, the guy who owns my shop…”</p>
<p>“Didn’t Felix say his father owned a few smithies?” Rightie said, turning to Scar.</p>
<p>Scar blinked. “He did. And I don’t see him in here…”</p>
<p>“And this was his ‘tip’, wasn’t it?” I said.</p>
<p>Scar growled. “If this is some kind of game to him--”</p>
<p>“It not,” I said. “While it would hardly surprise me to see merchants play politics with their fellows, accusations of lycanthropy are deadly serious.” I turned back to Matilda. “You should check in on your shop; I doubt this was his act alone.”</p>
<p>Matilda nodded. “I… I should. Yes. I’ll head to Pontius’ house first; he’ll want to know about this.”</p>
<p>“We’ll back you up,” Rightie said. “This is our responsibility.”</p>
<p>Matilda gave him a look that I wish I could also have given -- a mixture of shock and pity, coagulated with confusion. “I… think I’ll go find the rea-- regular Watch.” She turned back to me. “Thank you, mister Leafstorm.”</p>
<p>“Call me Barry!” I said, almost certain she wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“We have to find Felix,” Scar said, as Matilda shoved her way through the gently faltering bar tussle. “I can’t believe he’d use us like this. He was so committed.” </p>
<p>Rightie shrugged. “Merchants always treat guys like us as tools. He’s probably got a big line about being justified, anyway, and--”</p>
<p>I swept my arms around their shoulders (which was a bit of a stretch as far as Scar was concerned). “Yes. Terrible,” I said, pulling them a little closer to my level. “No doubt he has some great scheme in mind, to use fear and confusion to cement his family as the greatest metal merchants Surt has ever seen.” </p>
<p>I took a step forward, pulling them with me. “And there is only one way to find it.”</p>
<p>I stepped back, put a hand on each of their backs, and pushed, sending them both stumbling towards the door.</p>
<p>“Charge! Go forth! Adventure awaits! Revenge waits for no one -- not even the brave!”</p>
<p>Scar scrambled to her feet, eyes sparking. For a second, she looked like she was going to charge back over to me. Then her gaze softened, and she nodded, before turning and dashing towards the door.</p>
<p>Rightie stood up seconds later, looking more bemused than angry. “It was an honor, sir!” he said. </p>
<p>“The honor was mine,” I replied, forcing the frustration out of my voice. “Good luck!”</p>
<p>He waved, and then dashed after his partner.</p>
<p>I stumbled back over my table -- more from stress and exhaustion than inebriation, though inebriation was definitely at the forefront of my mind. I slipped back onto my lounge, scattering a lost fig that had somehow found its way there, and let myself puddle on the cushion until the tension retreated from my forehead. </p>
<p>I glanced back towards the bar. The barfight had faded into a bar trickle, and most of the patrons were back to drinking and dancing (though possibly with a bit less energy than before). Tallflower was nowhere in sight -- no doubt calculating the damage to add to my tab. And the potential cleanup costs as well.</p>
<p>I decided, however, that such concerns could wait. My hand drifted back to the table, and after a brief search, settled on my mug. I hastened it over to my lips. And then gasped.</p>
<p>It was completely fucking empty.</p>
<p>That was that, dear reader. This was the worst day of my life.</p>
