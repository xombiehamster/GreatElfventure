    <h1>A Wild Ride</h1>
    <p>In early spring Partager has been on the move for several weeks.  Cel hasn’t known Smilisca or Acris for very long, but she was aware that something was significantly wrong.  Acris had not even complained about his chores once since the flotilla got underway, and Smilisca wasn’t even assigning anything particularly smelly, difficult, or unpleasant.</p>
    <p>Things had become far too quiet on the raft.  The mood was bleak and Cel didn’t think she was going to accomplish anything remotely like Ehra’s challenge if all she was doing was collecting fishing bait or sorting lengths of string into bundles by color.  This would not do at all.</p>
    <p>So Cel, being Cel, straight up asked the dread wizard Smilisca what could possibly be wrong.</p>
    <p>And the dread wizard Smilisca sat on the bow of the raft, occasionally tossing snacks to their tow turtle, and scratched his head under his floppy and patched hat.  He looked away from Cel when she asked, and did not meet her eyes directly.</p>
    <p>“Weh...” he said slowly, as though chewing his words thoughtfully before finally spitting them out, “we’re just missin’ Sauver, Litoria’s hippo, that’s all.”</p>
    <p>Cel paused. Missing a beloved pet was something she could understand, and in her experience, wacky hijinks rarely provided a good resolution to such feelings. “I’m sorry for your loss,” she said, finally. </p>
    <p>“Thank you, Cel.”  Smilisca gives the tagalong a slow smile.  “We’ll see them again soon enough.”</p>
    <p>Cel raised an eyebrow. “Well that’s awfully dark,” she said. “Exciting, though. What’re we doing?” </p>
    <p>“Non, cher!”  Smilisca laughs at the misunderstanding.  “They done gone West on’a different river.  We’ll see ‘em again in the Winter.”</p>
    <p>“An’ right now we’re headin’ t’Surt.  All that copper on board thems’ other rafts were promised fer em’s up there.”</p>
    <p>“Ah. Eugh,” she said. “No wonder you both have long faces. Can’t we just stay on the river and roll past it? Check out the Marr a bit, catch some skelenewts, chase a few potbellies? Trust me, it’ll be a lot better than going in.”</p>
    <p>“Ain’t nothin’ for it.  We done made ‘em a promise.”  Smilisca shakes his head slowly.  “Nope, we’re a goin’ to Surt.”</p>
    <p>Cel chews at her lip. She’d spent an awfully long time trying to get away from there, in her opinion. Returning wasn’t exactly something she planned for anytime soon. “...Could you at least drop me off beforehand, and then pick me back up on the way out? I’d rather stalk the river with the ember hippos for a few days than go back into Surt -- though I guess you’re probably really going into Gerdr instead, and that’s not too bad. Docks at Gerdr are supposed to be neat; I heard if they close the gates too fast you’ll get split in half.”</p>
    <p>“Ember hippos?” Smilisca gives her a serious look, startled from his dedicated mope.  “You’ve seen hip’s out in the stinkin’ lake?”</p>
    <p>Cel blinks. “...Yeah. Loads of times. <span class="redacted">[Bluff DC 6: Yeah, she hasn’t seen jack. Sense Motive 3: But he totally believes her.]</span> They live right along the river, and in some of the lakes and places. Little red ones.”</p>
    <p>“I’m surprised we ain’t seen any yet, me.”  Smilisca strokes his beard in thought.  “Since yer the native expert, ken you find one?  Let me or one of ‘em Crocodilians know where it is.  It’s gon’ be real important.”</p>
    <p>Cel nods. “I bet I could find a few for you… but I’m gonna need some supplies. And some help; you can’t just walk up to a herd of them and grab one or two without getting bit or scaring them off. And honestly, the best place to find them isn’t always on the riverbank -- sometimes you’re better off with the alcohol lakes deep in the Marr, where wild ants and onagers stalk the wastes.” </p>
    <p>“You ken take Acris-” Smilisca starts, and then abruptly reconsiders, “mais non non, stay out of the alcohol lakes.  An you’s should probably not be stayin’ out overnight wi’ the gators set loose.  Acris ken help you git supplies.”</p>
    <p>"Awesome! Thank you!" Cel darts off to inform Acris of their exciting new mission.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Cel, of course, had a very different definition of “git supplies” than Smilisca had probably intended. Besides, all that stuff about “overnight with the gators” and “alcohol lakes are bad” was definitely just him being all frumpy and ruperty. Hey, someone’s got to set the stakes for a heroic adventure, right? Also, hippos count as supplies for sure.</p>
    <p>This is what she explained to Acris as she was dragging him off away from the flotilla to go find some hippos. Acris had agreed, and was now carrying the bag of old leather harnesses from when Sauver was a baby. It’s definitely enough.</p>
    <p>Cel, for once, actually had a pretty good idea where she was going. She and her horse hand spent a lot of time skirting around the maar. As night was falling, she dragged Acris northwest, towards the maar itself and she hoped some of the mineral springs that she swore she saw a hippo or two at. </p>
    <p>“Shouldn’t we be headin’ back soon, weh?”  Acris bumbles along behind Cel as she clearly knows where she’s going.  “Ain’t there gon’ be critters out here that’re bigger ‘en a hippo?”</p>
    <p>“Probably?” Cel says mildly. “But most of ‘em aren’t a big deal. Except the ostriches, maybe, but I bet we’ll see those well before they catch up to us. And there’s jackals, and ants, and onagers, and such, but they’re probably not gonna bother us.”</p>
    <p>She gestures over to a shriveled tree, a hundred paces further into the wilderness, it’s base obscured by the rising hillside. “There we go,” she says. “Where you find trees, you find water, right? So all we have to do is make it to that big one over there, and we’ll find a lake, and our hippos to boot.” </p>
    <p>“If’n you say so...” Acris heads off in that general direction.</p>
    <p>The sun gets lower on the short trek to the tree at the top of the hill. Sadly, this courageous conifer long since lost its battle with the toxic terrain of the maar. It is dessicated and long dead. Still, the hilltop provides a good view of the surrounding area. The pair can see the lights of the flotilla further behind them, but more interestingly a few colorful flashes of light somewhere further down the hillside in the growing dark.</p>
    <p>Squinting in the dark, the pair watches the strange lights for a few moments. They appear to be odd bursts of flames, briefly illuminating a small area. In the brief flashes of light, they can make out what seems to be a small pond-sized body of water. </p>
    <p>Cel glances at Acris. “...I don’t remember them spontaneously catching fire, but I was seeing them in daylight. And there is an alcohol lake down there. So hey, maybe we found them?” </p>
    <p>“Mais!  Looks like they’ll be easier ‘t spot in th’ dark then!”  Acris stumbles his way down the hill toward the pond.Cel nods, and dashes after him. </p>
    <p>As the pair approach the lights, it becomes apparent that the word "pond" is only correct in a technical sense. They find a pool of a bubbling, boiling liquid that occasionally fires off a gout of multicolored fire. A haze of steam covers the surface, and a stench like rotten eggs is so strong it makes Acris' skin itch.</p>
    <p>The pond seems shallow, maybe ankle deep, but it is wide and fills up most of the bottom of the shallow gully they are in. Through the brief firelight, they can see something in the middle of the pond - a thin strip of muddy ground about fifteen feet from shore. On that muddy bank is the huddled form of what looks like a small hippo. </p>
    <p>Cel scans the edge of the pond for possible hippo-feeding material, and then drops her backpack to the side, and starts digging through it for spare rations. “Okay,” she says to Acris. “So we’ve gotta find something that she’ll probably like, or we’re never going to get her out of there. I think I’ve got some jerky in here somewhere; it’s probably not as tasty as a chicken, but I bet she’ll go for it.” </p>
    <p>“Do hippos eat jerky, weh?”  Acris contemplates poking one toe in the water, then decides very strongly against wading in.</p>
    <p>As Acris approaches the surface of the pond, he suddenly feels very light headed. His vision goes blurry for a brief moment as the tingling sensation on his skin turns to burning.</p>
    <p>Wisely remembering his previous experience with airborne toxins, Acris hops backwards away from the liquid just as a bubble pops on the surface.</p>
    <p>A few tiny drops of acid sizzle on Acris' robes as he backs away, burning tiny holes in the fabric. His head clears a few seconds after he backs away, just barely managing to be unharmed.</p>
    <p>Cel shrugs, glancing nervously at the sizzling on Acris' robes. “I’ve definitely heard of them chasing birds, so… probably?” </p>
    <p>Acris rubs his webbed palms together excitedly.  He’s more than ready for this.  One could even say he definitely prepared a spell this morning.</p>
    <p>Speaking the magic words and clumsily making the arcane gestures, Acris creates a little magical <span class="AcrisMagic">scoop</span> that hovers in the air.</p>
    <p>“Aight Cel!  Stickem hippo food in here an we gon’ tempt ‘er over!”</p>
    <p>Cel smiles. "Right on!" She pulls a handful of poorly wrapped dried meat out of her pack, and poured it into Acris' magic scoop.</p>
    <p>Acris carefully floats the piece of jerky safely above the bubbling pool. He slowly moves the morsel over towards the hippo and moves it back and forth slowly.</p>
    <p>The hippo doesn't move at all, even when Acris moves the jerky close to its head for a few moments. Just as they are getting discouraged, they hear a noise from that direction - a muffled and tiny grunting noise. Acris recognizes the sound of a hippo easily, but it is far too soft and quiet to be from an adult hippo. </p>
    <p>Acris squinted in the dim light to try and see better.  He tried poking the hippo with the scoop. It does not move, but the sound continues.</p>
    <p>“Mais Cel?  Is that hip’ alive?”</p>
    <p>Cel chews her lip. "I hope so," she says. "I mean, it made hippo noises. Umm. Hmm. Maybe there's a way we can get to it?"</p>
    <p>She scans the surroundings again, checking for anything that could be used to bridge the lake. Her eyes fall on the dead tree.</p>
    <p>"Think we could chop that tree down?" she says. "That would get us partway across. And maybe we could get a better look at it." </p>
    <p>“Mebee?”  Acris keeps poking the large lump of hippo.  He’s just at his spell’s range.  “You got somethin to chop it with?”</p>
    <p>Cel puts a hand on the shortsword at her hip. "Maybe?" She takes a long look at the dead tree.  She stepped over to the edge of the tree, pulling the sword from her belt as she went, and gave the base of the tree an experimental “thwack”. The dry dead wood splinters and cuts easily.</p>
    <p>Acris returns the scoop full of snack food to their packs and scoops up some of the danger water instead.</p>
    <p>“Mais, let’s make sure the tree won’t go all to pieces instead of being a good bridge ‘afore we step on it, weh?”  He tests a twig in the scoop.</p>
    <p>The wood sizzles in the acidic liquid. The dry dead wood resists the damaging liquid, but only a little. It slowly breaks up, over the course of a few minutes. </p>
    <p>Cel grimaces. “Okay, so if we do this, it’ll have to be pretty fast. Lemme get this thing closer to the dropping point, and we can figure out a plan while I’m at it. Do we want to just rush over and try to hustle the hippo across? ...I don’t think it likes being over there, by the sound of it.” </p>
    <p>“Non,” Acris agrees, “We best just git it done with.”  He dismisses the spell to be able to help Cel with the tree moving procedure.</p>
    <p>Cel nods, and takes another several swings into the side of the tree, trying to force it to fall towards the lake rather than away from it. </p>
    <p>It takes a few whacks to bring the tree down and the hilt of Cel's sword rattles ominously on the last couple whacks, but down the tree goes. It rolls downhill easily, cracking off its withered branches as it goes. By the time they get it into position, it should be easy enough to shove into the caustic pool. </p>
    <p>“All aboard,” Cel says, hopping neatly onto the side of the tree. She scampered neatly over to the far end of the log, and gave the hippo a closer look.</p>
    <p>The dead tree pops and crackles underfoot, but holds strong. As Cel balances on the other end of the long, the fumes from the acid burn the inside of her nostrils and eyes. Her vision blurs painfully and she feels dangerously lightheaded, but she manages to keep her footing as she squints through the fumes.</p>
    <p>Though it's hard to see through the fumes, Cel manages to make out that the hippo lies in an unmoving heap. Cel is able to make out movement at the hippo's side, and realizes that there is a much smaller hippo nestled up against the fallen adult and crying out. </p>
    <p>Cel swallows back the bile crawling up her throat. She glances back at Acris, and then takes a step back, and tries to leap from the end of the tree onto the open dirt. Acris does his part and cheers her on from the relative safety of the shore.</p>
    <p>She lands feet-first in the mud on the other side, a scant foot from the edge of the boiling, acidic lake, and stumbles over to the hippo heap, and the tiny baby nestled along side of it. “Aww…” she says, frowning, scanning over both larger and smaller hippo. </p>
    <p>The baby hippo's skin is cracked and dry, and its eyes are red and watery. It grunts in fear and nuzzles closer to its mother. The mother hippo is gone. She has burns on her lower body, and might have been overwhelmed by the gas. Cel squints and sees something on the delicate folds of the mother's neck - two small pinpricks coated in dried blood.</p>
    <p>That's when Cel hears an angry hissing behind her. She hops forward with a yelp as something hits the back of her heavy blade elf boot. She shakes her foot and whirls around, kicking the snake free. The odd looking flatsnake hisses angrily and thrashes at her.</p>
    <p>“Oh fug,” Cel says, spinning. </p>
    <p>Acris was watching every movement through the mists with increasing concern.  When he hears Cel yelp and sees the snake rebound off her protective boot two thoughts cross his head: ‘Gosh that was close!’ followed quickly by ‘Maybe I should wear boots.’</p>
    <p>Neither distracts him long enough.  The apprentice wizard snaps out another quick incantation and complicated hand gesture and sends a <span class="AcrisMagic">bolt of magical force</span> flying at the serpent.  It strikes true, popping the flat snake with a low thwack sound.  The snake falls limp on the muddy ground, leaving Cel as safe as one can be when surrounded by toxic Maar.</p>
    <p>Cel grins. “Nice shot!” she shouts, bouncing up and down and waving in his direction… before immediately falling into a coughing fit seconds later. </p>
    <p>After a couple of seconds, she staggers back up, and hustles over to the fallen hippo and baby, dropping to her knees in the mud beside them. “Hey there, little girl,” she says, reaching a hand over and brushing a hand over its back. “You don’t want to be over here; this lake’s pretty awful.” </p>
    <p>The baby hippo warbles fearfully at first, but Cel's voice is gentle and she touches it softly and carefully. It shakes at her touch. She does not push. She continues making quiet noises that she hopes are comforting and gently stroking its back. It is warm to the touch.</p>
    <p>Cel forces herself to stay calm and quiet despite the stinging pain of the toxic gas. Slowly, the hippo stops shaking. Gingerly, it stands up on shaky legs. It slowly hobbles to Cel, nuzzling her foot and repeating the soft grunting noise. </p>
    <p>Cel gives her another reassuring pet, and then carefully scoops the tiny hippo into her arms, trying to keep her calm and secure. She then staggers to her feet, and glances at the log. “Might be better off if I put you in my pack, little girl,” she says quietly, unslipping her backpack from her shoulder. “Think you can handle that okay? It’ll be safe and dark in there, and there’s probably more food for you in it.” </p>
    <p>The hippo flops into the pack. It wiggles momentarily until it has turned around. It sits up in the pack nuzzling the back of Cel's neck and grunting fearfully. </p>
    <p>“All right,” Cel says, strapping the pack back onto her back. “Hold on tight; you’re going for a ride.”</p>
    <p>She turns back to the log, sets her shoulders, and makes a running jump for it. </p>
    <p>Her feet hit the lake a second later, a foot away from the edge of the log.</p>
    <p>She slaps a hand over her mouth, stifling a shriek, and leapt the rest of the way onto the log. The acid had shredded straight through her leather boots, leaving ugly yellow welts across her feet and calves that shriveled into scabs as the heat from the lake caught up with her flesh. She dashes the rest of the way across the log, and drops to her knees beside Acris, coughing and wincing. </p>
    <p>She slips the pack back off, and pulled open the leather drawstrings. The baby ember hippo rolls out onto the mud. She breathes in fresh air with a wheezing cough, then scrambles back to Cel, nuzzling and grunting.</p>
    <p>“Weh, I thinks th’ petite hip’s picked you ‘s ‘er favorite.”  Acris smiles at Cel cheerfully.  “I bets Oarmaster Staurois’ll be able t’ help with t-hip an you’s bein’ all sick.”</p>
    <p>“She’s adorable,” Cel says, coughing. She staggers back up. “Let’s head back so he can take a look. And cause I need new boots.” </p>
    <p>“Ken I pet her?” Acris hesitates, while offering Cel a hand to steady herself.</p>
    <p>“Thanks,” Cel says, taking it, and then pulling the baby hippo up to her shoulder. “And go for it. Don’t think she’ll mind if you’re gentle.”</p>
    <p>Acris very carefully pats the baby hippo on the snout while they walk back to Partager in the dark.  They deftly dodge the alligators on guard duty and head directly to the Oarmaster’s raft, right at the head of the flotilla.  Though it’s gotten quite late by the time they arrive, Oarmaster Staurois is awake and reading through a list of supplies.</p>
    <p>“Acris! Go to bed!  What’re you doing out here this late?”  The druid puts down his checklist and gives the two young elves a stern glare.</p>
    <p>“Finding hippos,” Cel says, yawning. </p>
    <p>“Hippos!” The Oarmaster’s surprised shout is loud enough to earn a complaining grumble from behind the closed curtain to the other room of his raft.  “Hippos?” he repeats much more quietly.  “Where did you find a hippopotamus, weh?”</p>
    <p>“Alcohol lakes, like I said,” Cel says. She gently sets the baby hippo onto the nearest table, trying very carefully not to wake her. “This one got a little lost, and the lake she was in was pretty acidic. So we rescued her.” </p>
    <p>Staurois reaches out to the little hippo and checks her vitals.  He seems surprised by the warmth of her skin, and is very careful about how he handles the sleeping hippopotamus.  He explains to Cell how she will need to care for the little hippo’s injuries, what ointments are needed for her cracked skin, what breathing treatments will help with her damaged lungs, and how very, very close they came to not successfully saving the baby ember hippo.</p>
    <p>And then the Oarmaster explains that the little hippo will be her responsibility to care for.</p>
    <p>Cel glances down at the hippo, and gives her head a gentle rub. “Well, she is pretty cute,” she says. She glances at Acris. “What’s a good hippo name?” </p>
    <p>“Them’s lotsa good names.”  Acris looks thoughtfully at the little red hippo.  “Mais, don’tchu want’ta be the one t’pick?”</p>
    <p>Cel shrugs. “I’m not really any good with names,” she says. “If you let me name her, I’m just going to name her Boots or something… on account of losing my boots while getting ‘er.” She gives the hippo another pat. “Not like that’s a bad name, though. What’d’ya think, Boots?” </p>
    <p>Boots snores peacefully in response.</p>
