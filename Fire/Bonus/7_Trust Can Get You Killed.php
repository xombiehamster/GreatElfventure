    <h1> Trust Can Get You Killed</h1> 
    <p>Something wild stumbled down the hallway.</p>
    <p>It was a spindly creature, yellow all over, with a thick mane of golden hair sticking out from its puffy saffron dressing robe. </p>
    <p>It lurched across the mansion's palm wood floors, coming to a stop in front of a wide door, painted in an elaborate fresco of a seaside vista. It scrabbled at the door latch.</p>
    <p>The door slid open, revealing a wide roofed balcony, with an ornate marble tub built into the center. Flowering vines dangled from the edge of the roof. The tub was filled with smoke-colored water, with scattered flowers floating on top. A mug of brown liquid sat beside it.</p>
    <p>The creature shucked its bathrobe and dropped face first into the tub.</p>
    <p>It came up, spluttering, scant seconds later. "Little cold today," Barrabus Leafstorm rasped, dropping a hand down to the mug besides his tub. He took a swift gulp, and then grimaced. "Cold swamp water was better than this. I should have stayed on vacation. Mister Herringbone!"</p>
    <p>"Here, sirrah," Mister Herringbone said, stepping through the doorway. He was a wide, squarish elf, with crimson skin and smoke-white hair curling up from his temples. One hand held a plate, set with breadslices covered in soft cheese and thick purple jam. </p>
    <p>“You’re an angel, Mister Herringbone,” Barrabus said, his mouth smoking. He grabbed a slice of bread and bit into it; the smell of toasting bread and melting cheese wafted into the air. “Am Belisse, mimimumm,” he continued, and then swallowed. “Busy morning? The bath is a little cool.”</p>
    <p>Herringbone’s jaw dropped. “My-- my humblest apologies, master Leafstorm,” he said. He gave Barrabus a deep bow; the plate in his hand hardly wavered. “There is no excuse for such negligence! I’ll dock my pay at once!”</p>
    <p>“No need, Mister Herringbone,” replied Barrabus, who had convinced the Imperialis to pay his staff’s salary more than a year ago. “I’m sure you were quite busy butlering. I’ll simply warm the water myself.”</p>
    <p>Herringbone stared at Barrabus incredulously, awe and disgust alike spreading across his face.</p>
    <p>“With presdigitation, Herringbone,” Barrabus said, shoving the rest of his breadslice into his mouth. “Geft your mimnd out of the guftter.”</p>
    <p>“Of course, sirrah,” Herringbone said. </p>
    <p>Barrabus waved his arms over the tub, forming complicated, sweeping loops that traced lines of fire through the air. Within five minutes, the water was shimmering with heat. He glanced back up at Herringbone, who was still standing close by, his hand holding out the plate of jammed bread. </p>
    <p>Barrabus squinted. “You have jam on your tunic, Mister Herringbone,” he said, gesturing to a smattering of red tracing the hem of Herringbone’s shirt. “Let me get that for you.”</p>
    <p>Herringbone’s eyes widened. “Sirrah--” </p>
    <p>“Think nothing of it,” Barrabus said. He waved a hand over Herringbone’s chiton; the red spots vanished with tiny yellow sparks. “I had already cast the spell, and there is no need for you to punish yourself for making me breakfast.”</p>
    <p>Barry scooped up the other breadslices with one hand. “Anyway, I have an early meeting in the Agora today. Festivities to plan, etc, etc. I’ll need a few minutes to finish my breakfast; do me a solid and set up an appropriately business casual outfit in my dressing room, would you please?”</p>
    <p>“A ‘solid’, sirrah,” Herringbone said solidly, nodding. He swept silently out through the balcony door.</p>
    <p>Barrabus leaned back and began tearing through the slices of bread, scattering specks of jam and cheese into his cloudy bath. After the last crumbs were either in his mouth or his tub, he let himself slide deep into the pool, so that only his face was visible. </p>
    <p>Smiling, Barrabus closed his eyes.</p>
    <p>For about six seconds.</p>
    <p>“Overhyped skin-smoothing luxury bathing over,” Barry said to himself. He stood up, squared his shoulders, and marched out of the marble tub, and over to a large firepit set into the stonework nearby. “Time for some real cleaning.” </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Barrabus whistled to himself as he marched through the Agora, glancing around at the wood and stonework sets being painted and decorated in preparation for the Solstice Festival. Herringbone had prepared for him an elaborate yellow tunic, traced with cloth of gold along the edges and highlighted by a deep green vest and shortcape lined with bone buttons. It matched well with his hat (currently set to “feathered default mode”) and his thin brown sandals, though it made him look a bit too much like a “merchant prince” for his liking. </p>
    <p>The scenery was much more to his taste. Shops and stalls all across the Agora had been or were being painted a wide variety of purples, yellows, reds, and blues, made from thin ash pigments composed by Surt’s various alchemists. A dozen large stone tables sat towards the center of the marketplace, while towards the far side, three score Firedancers were practicing complicated and risque maneuvers over sandbags and stacks of logs. </p>
    <p>And of course, at the back stood a rickety fence, draped with canvas and marked in chalk with ‘Maestro Fizzaoli’s Wondrous Exhibition - Stage Currently Under Construction’, as well as a few cheesy slogans, such as ‘Within these walls, trust nothing -- not your senses, not your self!’.</p>
    <p>And in front of it, just by the fence door, stood the Fury.</p>
    <p>Barry rolled his eyes. He took a second to straighten his hat and vest, and then marched prominently over to the door, keeping his nose in the air and his eyes on the scenery.</p>
    <p>The door slid open, revealing a thin fire elf with almost fluorescent orange skin, and matching hair and chiton. “Yes?” he said, his eyes fixed on a point over Barrabus’ head.</p>
    <p>“Barrabus Leafstorm,” Barrabus said, arching up a little to force the elf to meet his gaze. “I have an appointment with the Maestro this morning. He’ll be most pleased to see me. So if you would be so kind as to--”</p>
    <p>“The Maestro is not to be disturbed,” the elf said. “He is communing with the spirits.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus nodded pleasantly, and dropped a foot onto the doorframe to prevent the elf from closing it. “Totally understand, dear chum, but it is quite important I meet with him early. I’m sure he will be compensated for the time los--”</p>
    <p>“The Maestro will inform me when he is ready for visitors,” the elf said, glaring. “Please wait here.”</p>
    <p>He slammed the gate door back into its frame, catching Barrabus’ retreating foot just before it could escape.</p>
    <p>“Ow! Kriest! Lycanshit! Ow!” Barrabus said, hopping up and down and rubbing at his scratched toes. </p>
    <p>He heard a chuckling behind him.</p>
    <p>The Fury was watching the Firedancers to the right -- or at least pointedly looking away from the doorway, and failing to hide the grin trying to trace across her face. She was wearing a single-shoulder, purple and red chiton -- a new one, by Barrabus’ guess -- and holding a pile of parchment notes behind her back. </p>
    <p>Barry leaned sideways, trying to get a better look at the writing on those notes. Once again, he found himself wishing he’d taken up his ‘cousin’ Vinnie’s offer of pickpocketing lessons back when he was a kid.</p>
    <p>The door slid back open. “Ahem,” the orange elf said, peering through the doorway. “The Maestro will see you now. This way, please.” He turned and sauntered back into the worksite, leaving the door partway open behind him.</p>
    <p>Barrabus glanced at the door, and then at the Fury, before darting over to the doorway himself and gently pushing the door back open. “Ladies first, your Furious-ness,” he said, giving the Fury a sardonic bow. </p>
    <p>The Fury turned, met Leafstorm’s eyes, and gave him a sharp, withering glare -- one he returned with equal measure. Crimson and golden sparks popped into the air between them.</p>
    <p>Barry looked away first. “Bitch,” he said quietly.</p>
    <p>“Fop,” she replied.</p>
    <p>“Carbuncle.”</p>
    <p>“Bedswerver.”</p>
    <p>“Sorning fribble.”</p>
    <p>“Stymphallist.”</p>
    <p>“Clearly your business isn’t that important, your raving highness,” Barrabus hissed, “so I’ll just go ahead first--”</p>
    <p>“Oh no you don’t, damnit,” the Fury said, rushing for the gate. </p>
    <p>Barry darted forward, managing to get one foot through the doorway before the Fury crashed into him, shoving herself sideways through the door hip-first. Barry shoved back, throwing a shoulder around the doorframe and levering himself through with his elbow, while bracing his other arm against the frame on the opposite side. The Fury ducked under his outstretched arm, and pushed both hands against his chest, throwing him off-balance and giving her just enough support to throw her other hip through… and causing her to catch both feet on Barry’s outstretched leg. </p>
    <p>The two toppled through the doorway.</p>
    <p>Barrabus rolled immediately to his feet, securing his hat as he went. Fortune was on his side; the elf in orange did not appear to have noticed, and the others working on Fizzaoli’s stage (two painters in mismatched leathers, he noted, who were halfway up their ladders; three stagehands, covered in black linen, and busy rolling a circular table somewhere; a Praesidum guard in a purple-stained uniform, eating the remnants from a high-end catering table, likely deployed early that morning) were only now turning around to catch the commotion. And it had only been half an hour since breakfast -- short enough that the presdigitation he had cast this morning was still available. </p>
    <p>He flicked his wrist, wiping a cloud of ash and sawdust from his vest with a trail of sparks, and turned a full-effect Leafstorm smile over to the stagehands turning his way. “Nothing to be concerned with, dear sirs,” he said quickly. “Her grace took a mild tumble on your doorstep.”</p>
    <p>The guard blinked, and then dropped into hasty salute. “Lord Leafstorm,” she said, swallowing. “Sir!”</p>
    <p>The two painters slid off their ladders, and the stagehands propped their table sideways. All five rushed over to doorway. </p>
    <p>“Lord Barrabus, sir!” said a stagehand, pulling the linen cap from his head. “Pleasure to see you!”</p>
    <p>	“What brings you here, sirrah?” said one of the painters, his brush dripping tangerine on the Fury’s gown. She had pulled herself into a crouch, and was now staggering back to her feet.</p>
    <p>“Civic business, I’m afraid,” Barrabus said, surreptitiously offering the Fury a hand. “We have important business with the Maestro regarding his upcoming performances, and I’m afraid we have little time for delay.”</p>
    <p>The Fury grabbed his arm and hauled herself the rest of the way to her feet, and giving the Maestro’s stageworkers a warm smile, weakened only slightly by the dark sparks popping at her feet. The crowd took a step back. </p>
    <p>Barrabus glanced around. The gate greeter hadn’t stopped; he was well passed the stageworks by this point, and was now going around a series of tarp huts set up close to the lot’s back edge. </p>
    <p>“Our guide is leaving us behind,” he said, “so I’m afraid we’ll have to leave you gentlefolk behind in a bit of a rush. If one of you would kindly tell us where the Maestro is quartered…”</p>
    <p>“Blue and yellow tent at the far back left, sir,” the guard said. “Behind the stage. I can show you--”</p>
    <p>“No need,” Barrabus said, treating her to a particularly bright smile. “We’re in something of a hurry now… but I’ll be more than happy to come back and visit with you fine folk afterwards, as thanks.”</p>
    <p>The guard brightened.</p>
    <p>Barrabus dashed forward. He waited until he was almost around the stage’s corner before glancing back.</p>
    <p>The crowd at the gate had all dispersed save the guard, who met his gaze for a brief second before turning back to the entranceway. The Fury was close behind him -- covered in dust and ash, blindingly bright, and looking all together dangerously within her namesake. </p>
    <p>Barry grimaced, and slowed to let the Fury catch up. “I have a spell at the ready that might help--” he said quietly.</p>
    <p>“I know,” the Fury hissed, glaring literal sparks. </p>
    <p>She stopped, and closed her eyes for a few seconds, her inferno glow fading by the time she opened them. “Please,” she said through gritted teeth. </p>
    <p>Barry nodded, and weaved a complicated pattern of fire in the Fury’s direction. The ash and paint specks misted off of her chiton.</p>
    <p>“Thanks,” the Fury said quietly. She reached a hand up, and started patting down the angrier columns of her hair.</p>
    <p>“You’re welcome,” Barry said.</p>
    <p>“Stampcrab scoundrel.”</p>
    <p>“Klazomaniac.”</p>
    <p>Fury blinked. “That’s a new one,” she said, heading off down the line of tents.</p>
    <p>“Traditionally, ‘one who speaks only by shouting,’ “ Barry said. </p>
    <p>Fury rolled her eyes. “Says the elf who can’t enter a room without screaming posh nonsense at everyone in it.”</p>
    <p>"You wound me, madam." Barrabus pointed to a tent at the end of the row -- deep blue, and down with irregular yellow stars. The orange elf stood outside of it, talking quietly to a man and woman in matching extra-short blue tunics. “I believe we’re here.”</p>
    <p>As they approached, one of the two blue-clad elves dashed over to them; Barrabus squinted at them, noting that they wore irregular white stars that seemed to match the design of the tent, and that the charcoal paste around their eyes was smeared with tears. </p>
    <p>“The Fury, your grace,” the closer of the two puffed as she approached. “And Lord Barrabus. There’s been a murder.”</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>“Sharp wounds -- claw marks, in fact,” Barrabus said, feigning confidence. “I am no expert, mind you, but the, err, ragged edges around the… liver here… are quite clear.” He turned and looked at the Fury. “He likely died quickly, no matter which wound took him.”</p>
    <p>“A wild animal?” The Fury said. She was perched atop a tall stool, next to a worktable covered in clay jars, and was actively rubbing at one ankle with both hands. “A creature from the caverns, maybe? Or something brought in for the festival?”</p>
    <p>“If so, its an intelligent one,” Barrabus said. “It knew precisely where to hit him. And some of this is clearly excessive; whatever did this wanted to be absolutely sure.” He paused. “Is your foot all right?”</p>
    <p>The Fury glared at him. The edges of her eyes glowed pale violet. “Stay on task, Barry.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus sighed. “I don’t see any sign of eating… or biting at all, really, unless the creature in question has really wide jaws and knives for teeth.” He circled around the table, carefully avoiding the body atop it, and the numerous blood spots scattered around. “Whatever it was, it removed his head -- likely to prevent resurrection or communication attempts. And the path from here is fastidiously clean, suggesting that someone stopped to clean up their mess afterwards.” He paused by an open cosmetics cabinet, featuring numerous wigs, jars, and a large brass mirror detailed with draconic symbols. “The Maestro was killed here, most likely while preparing himself for the day’s practice. No more than a few hours ago, at most.”</p>
    <p>“That fits with what his assistants said,” the Fury replied. “They both ate breakfast with him this morning. Then he went in here to prepare himself, and then they came in to check on him and found… this.”</p>
    <p>“And before breakfast?”</p>
    <p>“They were asleep. All three of them, in one bed.”</p>
    <p>“The benefits of leadership,” Barrabus mused. </p>
    <p>The Fury rolled her eyes. “You would know, bedswerver.”</p>
    <p>“I do not swerve into beds,” Barrabus said. “I merely stand still, and they deviate in my direction of their own recourse.” He clenched his fist until it glowed hot-yellow, and then waved it in front of him, illuminating the back end of the tent. </p>
    <p>“You deviate all right,” the Fury said. She paused. “I’m seeing a lot of minor auras over here, but nothing serious yet. And nothing from the body.”</p>
    <p>The far end of the tent was set with half a dozen racks and shelves, with leather strips dangling from their frames -- likely to secure the contents during transport. Most of the drawers were open, revealing glittering spheres, feather tokens, and exotic birds carved from clay. A fat wooden rod, small enough to fit inside a closed fist, jutted out from a drawer stacked high with parchment drawings. Barrabus bent a little closer.</p>
    <p>The drawer was scratched on the inside, as if someone had tried to close it, but couldn’t quite fit the rod into it. A few flecks of red shined on the floor underneath.</p>
    <p>“And over here?” Barrabus said, fishing the rod out of the drawer. The outside was smooth, save for a filligree’d carving on the back, featuring an elaborate stick figure. Someone had tried to paint over the carving with brown paint, but time and friction had rubbed the majority off. He held the rod up, to give Fury a clear line of sight.</p>
    <p>The Fury smiled. “A wand of presdigitation. Now that’s fitting.”</p>
    <p>“Clever, too,” Barrabus replied. “Easily concealed, and thus perfect for stage tricks. As well as cleaning up a crime scene, I suppose.”</p>
    <p>“I see a few other minor items… there are a couple healing and invisibility potions towards the back there, and some kind of one-use summoning charm in the drawer to your right…”</p>
    <p>“Clay pigeons,” Barrabus said. “A classic and completely forgettable trick, made more palatable with more exotic birds.”</p>
    <p>“And of course your stupid hat.”</p>
    <p>“Why does everyone I know feel the need to carp and grumble about my hat?” Barry asked. “Its respectable and useful, and keeps birdshit out of my hair.”</p>
    <p>“It makes you look like a--”</p>
    <p>“A what?” Barrabus said. He turned back around.</p>
    <p>The Fury was squinting at something over his shoulder. “Something’s… not right. Out there, in the stage area… just on the edge of my detect magic. It feels like your hat… but there’s something wrong with it, and I can’t quite get what--”</p>
    <p>The tent's doorflap swished open. </p>
    <p>“All right, Mister Barrabus,” a tall elf said. He wore the blue and bronze uniform of Surt’s Constabulary Guard, and had a shining breastplate on his chest and bronze arming sword at his hip. His cheekbones were sharp, even for an elf, and were poorly concealed behind a red handlebar mustache. His bronze eyes were fixed on Barrabus. “I see you’ve found yerself another caper again, eh? Best get out so the real detectives can take a look at the crime scene.”</p>
    <p>“Good morning, Inspector Stormbadger,” the Fury said, rubbing her eyes through her mask.</p>
    <p>Stormbadger did a double take, which he switched neatly into a salute, followed by a bow. “Yer pardon, yer grace,” he said. “The Civilie did not mention that you were looking into it as well.”</p>
    <p>“I just happened to be here when the body was discovered,” the Fury said. “Barrabus and I both had meetings scheduled with the deceased."</p>
    <p>Stormbadger nodded. "A concerning coincidence."</p>
    <p>"Not important for now," the Fury said. "Lock down the exits. Someone in here is a shapeshifter."</p>
    <p>Stormbadger's eyes bulged. He turned and stared at Barrabus.</p>
    <p>"I meant on the stage!" the Fury said. "Not inside this tent!"</p>
    <p>"Yer sure, yer grace?" Stormbadger's hand was drifting to his sword hilt. </p>
    <p>Barrabus was staring at the insignia on the back of the wand. He waggled his fingers over it, spraying a cloud of paint dust off of the filigree’d edges. Six arms stuck out from the stick figure’s back.</p>
    <p>"I trust Barry one hundred percent," the Fury snapped. "Now get moving before whatever it is sneaks out!"</p>
    <p>“Trust is a dangerous thing these days,” Stormbadger said, pulling the tent flap back open. “But as you say, yer grace. As you say.”</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>“I had the site contained as soon as I got the message,” Captain Doukas said. He was solid, tall, and surprisingly wide and barrel-chested for an elf; Barrabus had occasionally wondered if the Captain had a bit of human in his ancestry. Or perhaps ogre. “Well before the inspector found you. Provided it hasn’t changed into something flying or invisible, whatever it is should still be in here.”</p>
    <p>“That was clever thinking, captain,” the Fury said. </p>
    <p>“Well… truth be told, your grace, I did it mostly because I heard it was Leafstorm that was on the scene,” he continued. “Can’t seem to go a month without him in some incident or another, and a good half the time its a nightmare. Anyway, we found only ten of you in here total -- so that’s eight suspects, excluding yourselves of course.”</p>
    <p>“Do we have support casters on site?”</p>
    <p>“All the ones we’ve got, but…” Captain Doukas frowned, causing his smog-brown copstash to cover most of his mouth. “We’re not a quiet bunch, your grace, and there are lots of spells and doohickies that can hide even supernatural shapechanging. If this murderer is smart, he’s already got himself covered, and is waiting for our casters to tucker out before he makes a move.”</p>
    <p>The Fury nodded. “Have your casters start combing the area, starting with Maestro Fizzaoli’s tent. Barry and I will accompany the inspector as he interviews the suspects.”</p>
    <p>The captain nodded, and waved forward a pair of guards in blackened chainmail. “Dandelion and Rosescruff are two of my best. They’ll back you up.”</p>
    <p>The captain and both guards saluted, and then Doukas marched off, shouting orders to a pair of adepts standing in front of the catering table. Inspector Stormbadger stepped closer; he had been examining the wand a few paces away.</p>
    <p>"I recognize the marker," he said quietly. "Its the symbol of the Grasp, a Calestrian group from back in old Muspelham. I was foot patrol on the dockside back then; had more than a few strange scenes come up with this symbol attached."</p>
    <p>"So this creature might be associated with them?" Barrabus said.</p>
    <p>"Or hunting 'em," Stormbadger said. "The Grasp always seemed to lose more fights than win."</p>
    <p>"Wait," the Fury said. "That sounds like a cult. We had a cult?"</p>
    <p>"Aye, yer grace," Stormbadger said. "And probably still do. Some of 'em are pretty tenacious -- especially the Calestrian ones. I think we even had a food cult at one point. Buggers'll get up to anything if given the chance."</p>
    <p>“Had a cult?” Barrabus said, eyebrow raised. “The Ashen gangs don’t merit, your Furious-ness?”</p>
    <p>The Fury glared. “The Ashen sects are--”</p>
    <p>“What in the blue hellions of Bellaphex is that idiot doing?” Stormbadger said. He darted forward, hauling himself ungracefully onto the edge of the stage.</p>
    <p>Barrabus and the Fury looked up.</p>
    <p>One of the assistants -- the one that approached them earlier -- was aggressively shoving her partner into a small wooden coffin, covered in small holes that had been artfully disguised with intricate black stars. A number of thin swords lay on the table to her right, along with a wide bucksaw. Fear and terror were stretched almost comically across her target’s face, and he clung helplessly to the edges of the coffin as she forced him further in.</p>
    <p>The painters, stagehands, and the Praesidium guard from earlier were all lounging at the edge of the stage, with one of the stagehands holding up a two-foot sign that read “remember dear audience -- trust can get you killed” in black stencil. All six reacted with shock as Stormbadger charged across the stage.</p>
    <p>Stormbadger was on the assistant in seconds, grabbing both arms and twisting them behind her back, while sweeping her legs out from under her. She dropped face-first onto the carpeted stage; the inspector drove a knee into her back, and tore a set of manacles from his belt… just in time for the other assistant to drive a knee into his nose. Stormbadger toppled, catching himself on his assailant’s tunic, and then hauling him down and wrapping a hand over his throat.</p>
    <p>Barrabus leapt onto the stage. He grabbed the inspector by the arm. “It was an act, Stormbadger. Part of their performance.”</p>
    <p>The inspector blinked, and glanced over at the wooden coffin, and the ‘swords’ on the table next to it. The paint on several of them was so thin that, from this close, Barrabus could see the woodgrain underneath. “Oh,” Stormbadger said. He wiped a dribble of steaming blood from beneath his nose. “I feel a fool now, that’s fer certain.” He stood up.</p>
    <p>“A tribute to your acting skills, sir,” Barrabus said, looking at the male assistant, who was now rubbing his neck unhappily.</p>
    <p>“I think you broke my ribs,” the other moaned. She was still lying face-first on the carpeted stage.</p>
    <p>“I can help with that!” the Fury said, hoisting herself onto the edge of the stage. Rosescruff, who had already climbed up, grabbed her arm and hauled her to a standing position; Dandelion was scanning the stage, keeping his shield up and close to his face. </p>
    <p>The assistant scrambled to her feet, and she and her partner gave the Fury showy bows. “Its fine, really, your grace,” she said quickly. “No need to trouble yourself. Nothing a good bath won’t cure.”</p>
    <p>“You’re quite good,” Barrabus said, flashing a well-practiced ‘quiet approving grin’.</p>
    <p>They both grinned back. “Thank you, my lord,” she said. “It’s one of our best. Called ‘Confidence’ on the playbills.”</p>
    <p>“We were practicing to calm our nerves,” the other said, slipping a hand into the other one’s grip. “I’m Felix, by the way. This is my partner Juna.”</p>
    <p>“Well, Felix, Juna,” Barrabus said, addressing each of them in turn. “Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?”</p>
    <p>Felix glared at Stormbadger. “We’ll answer any questions you or her grace have for us, my Lord.”</p>
    <p>“Any questions,” Juna said with a wink.</p>
    <p>“Were you close with the Maestro?” Barrabus asked.</p>
    <p>“Close as any would be to that fink, I suppose,” Juna said.</p>
    <p>“Fizzaoli was our long-term employer,” Felix said. “We apprenticed to him just after the war started to calm down. Neither of us had much choice back then; food could get hard to come by, but Fizzaoli always seemed to have plenty. Fancy stuff, too; food I’d never even heard of. And he taught us his acts; even made a few new ones with us in mind. Juna makes it sound bad, but he... took care of us.” </p>
    <p>Juna grimaced. “I don’t like how he treated you, Felix. I don’t like how he treated us. And you didn’t hear what he said behind your back. I don’t know what happened to him, but whatever did, he deserved it.”</p>
    <p>Felix paled. He glanced Stormbadger, and twisted right, as if shielding Juna from him.</p>
    <p>“But you shared his bed,” Stormbadger said quietly. </p>
    <p>“We did,” Juna said. “Didn’t give us a choice on that.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus nodded. “Give us a second, if you please,” he said. He pulled the Fury off to the side, stopping a few paces away.</p>
    <p>He glanced back. Stormbadger was apologizing; Juna and Felix seemed to accept it. As Barrabus watched, they answered a few more of the inspector’s questions, watching nervously as Stormbadger scrawled them into a notebook.</p>
    <p>“Juna seems legitimate,” Barry whispered, turning to the Fury. “But Felix is definitely holding something back. If I’m right, then he has strong motive.”</p>
    <p>“They didn’t do it,” the Fury whispered back. Here eyes were glowing in a way that made even Barry’s eyes water. </p>
    <p>“You don’t think a pair of abused adolescents would murder their abuser and cut off his head?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think they would have cleaned up afterwards,” the Fury said. “Or stuck around. And why would they then report the body to us? And not know how to hide the wand they cleaned up with?”</p>
    <p>Barry nodded.</p>
    <p>“Plus,” she continued, “Fizzaoli died a bit too fast for that. If I-- if it were them, it would have been either slow or fast and well-hidden; not a fast death, followed by some cuts just to make a mess.”</p>
    <p>Barry paused. “Did… something happen?”</p>
    <p>The Fury paled. “It’s not important.”</p>
    <p>“It seems important to you. You can tell me.”</p>
    <p>“No I can’t,” she said, through clenched teeth. “Drop it.”</p>
    <p>Barry leaned in a little closer, and stared right into the Fury’s eyes. “What happened to ‘I trust Barry one hundred percent’?”</p>
    <p>The Fury swallowed. Her hand went up to her face -- to the flame-carved mask covering its top. “There are some things I can’t say, even to those I trust.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus frowned. He took a step back. “Why were you meeting with Fizzaoli this morning?”</p>
    <p>The Fury’s jaw dropped open. Her hands fell to her hips. “Why were <em>you</em> meeting with Fizzaoli this morning?” she snarled.</p>
    <p>Barrabus glared. The Fury glared back.</p>
    <p>A loud cough sounded from a little further up the stage. “Pardon me, yer grace,” Stormbadger said, marching over to them. He eyed Barrabus suspiciously.</p>
    <p>The Fury nodded, and a bit of the heat drained from her face. “Of course, inspector.”</p>
    <p>“Juna and Felix check out, in my opinion,” he said, clearly noting the smug look the Fury gave Barrabus as he said it. “Want to keep them for questioning, but they seem more victim than perp here to me. I think our Fizzaoli was up to some shit; the two confirmed that he had a lot of supplies marked with the ol’ “six-armed Cal”, as well as some others belonging to the Cult of Liberation and a few other wild weirdos from here and back in Musp. My guess is he was some sort of front, or maybe an info broker and go-between. </p>
    <p>“They said most of his gimmicks came from an elf named Mothleaf; they think he was some sort o’ tinkerer. He’s got a caravan cart set up for the festival, but he didn’t really follow the act anywhere; just showed up on occasion. Juna said he left without it the day before yesterday, and hasn’t been back since, as far as they know.”</p>
    <p>“We should interrogate the guard next, then,” Barrabus said. “Perhaps someone came looking for him.”</p>
    <p>Stormbadger nodded.</p>
    <p>They stepped off the stage and over to the fence, while the inspector escorted the young Civile over to meet with them. She stepped up, and gave both Barrabus and the Fury a sharp salute, marred only slightly by the breakfast stains on her uniform. “Hello again, your grace, Lord Leafstorm,” she said, her eyes sticking more to ‘Lord Leafstorm’ than ‘her grace’. “I’ll be more than happy to answer any questions you have for me.”</p>
    <p>“Then let us start with your name, my dear,” Barrabus said, deploying ‘smile number six -- wickedly tempting’ (at least according to some experiments in a mirror).</p>
    <p>The guard glowed. “Nerilla Treerook, soldier of the Honest Lasses, under Tesserarius Calipso Brightland. I started my guard shift here at dawn this morning, and was requisitioned to help cover the festival grounds during setup as of last week.”</p>
    <p>“Anything unusual happen this morning, private?” Stormbadger asked.</p>
    <p>Nerilla shook her head. “Caterer came in just as dawn broke, and then the Maestro and his assistants came out to have breakfast. The stagehands came in sometime after that, followed by the painters, and then Mister Mothleaf, carrying in another box.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus blinked. “Mr. Mothleaf?” he said.</p>
    <p>“You sure?” Stormbadger said.</p>
    <p>Nerilla nodded. “I’ve never talked to the guy, but it was definitely him. Orange hair, orange clothes, orange skin… Not really a forgettable combination.”</p>
    <p>“That’s the guy who met us at the gate,” the Fury said. She turned and scanned the stageyard. Barrabus did likewise. </p>
    <p>“Aye, ma’am,” Nerilla said.</p>
    <p>“And he’s not down here!” Barrabus said. He turned and darted onto the stage, where Felix and Juna were taking down their wooden coffin. “You said you had not seen Mothleaf today,” he said quickly.</p>
    <p>Juna nodded. “That’s right.”</p>
    <p>“Then who was it that you were talking to when the Fury and I found you?”</p>
    <p>“Some delivery guy,” Felix said. “Or that’s what I thought at least. Kept asking where Fizzaoli was and what he looked like.”</p>
    <p>“He looked kind of like Mothleaf, but the face was way off,” Juna said. “He might have been a cousin or his. Not really sure where he went after you two showed up.”</p>
    <p>Stormbadger and the Fury dashed up to them, with Nerilla and the two Constabulary trailing close behind. </p>
    <p>“Do you know where Mothleaf’s cart is?” Barrabus asked.</p>
    <p>“I know where it is!” Nerilla said. “Its the orange one by the outhouses, right?”</p>
    <p>Juna nodded.</p>
    <p>“I pass that on my patrol every day,” Nerilla said. “I can lead you there!”</p>
    <p>Barrabus nodded. He turned to Stormbadger. “Inspector, let Captain Doukas know we think we’ve found our shapechanger.”</p>
    <p>The inspector glanced over to the Fury, who nodded, and then to Dandelion and Rosescruff, who saluted uncomfortably. He sighed. “For the love of… anyone, Mister Barrabus, don’t start a fight until we’re all backing you up. The Terror will be here any minute, and she will go completely spare if you spring some Lycan trap on us while we’re still organizing. Completely. Fucking. Spare.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus smiled (number two -- stolid and reassuring). “I assure you, Inspector--”</p>
    <p>Stormbadger grimaced, and held a hand to his head. “Don’t. Just don’t. Yer giving me that headache you give me right when you fuck up my weekend. Just… completely fucking spare. ‘Member that.”</p>
    <p>The inspector turned, and dashed towards the stageways entrance, gathering constabulary as he went.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>True to its theme, the caravan cart was ostentatiously orange, complete with fancy goldenrod ornamentation and solid ochre doors. The cart itself was big enough to house a bed and several occupants, and Barrabus guessed it would take a team of at least six oxen to pull it. None of which were in sight.</p>
    <p>The cart was dark, and the wooden shutterframe windows on the car's top edge had been closed, and smeared from the inside with what looked like thick mud.</p>
    <p>“Any chance we could peek inside?” the Fury asked. The five of them were crouched behind another cart -- this one a normal oxcart, empty save for a few tent stakes.</p>
    <p>Barrabus nodded. “Those shutters may be useable once cleaned off, but not a one of us is tall enough to peek into them alone.”</p>
    <p>“And your presdigitation is still handy?” </p>
    <p>“Barely,” he replied. “But I can always recast it as we need.”</p>
    <p>“Right,” the Fury said. “We’ll get close enough so you can sweep the shutters from ground level, and then I’ll climb onto someone’s shoulders and peek in.”</p>
    <p>Barry’s jaw dropped open. “No. You’re not doing that.”</p>
    <p>“Why not?” the Fury asked. “I’ll have spells ready. I’m probably the lightest of us. And I’m just going to take a look.”</p>
    <p>Barry gestured to the rest of the group. Dandelion and Rosescruff were shaking their heads. Nerilla was looking at her like she was crazy.</p>
    <p>“Your grace…” she said. “You’re not sticking your head where a Lycan can tear it off, your grace. Please.”</p>
    <p>“It appears you’re outvoted, your furiousness,” Barry said.</p>
    <p><em>“Good thing we’re not a democracy,</em>” the Fury hissed.</p>
    <p>“Peeking in is a poor move anyway,” Barrabus said. “Clearing the muck from those shutters will alert whatever is inside. All we need to know is if there is something inside. And all that requires, to start with, is for someone to listen at the door.”</p>
    <p>Barrabus hesitated, well aware that ‘listening at the door’ is both probably the appropriate heroic action to take, and a far riskier activity than hiding behind an oxcart next to a powerful spellcaster. Still, the moment where “not volunteering” would become a faux pas was fast approaching. “I--”</p>
    <p>“I’ll do it,” Nerilla said. </p>
    <p>Barrabus crushed down an internal sigh of relief. “Are you sure, Nerilla?”</p>
    <p>She nodded. “I’ve got good ears. And it’s my patrol job anyway.”</p>
    <p>“We’ll be with you in seconds,” Barrabus said. “Stay quiet, and run for it if anything starts coming out. We’ll cover you. All we need is confirmation that something is moving around inside.”</p>
    <p>Nerilla dropped a hand onto Barrabus’. “I trust you,” she said sweetly, pulling a (number one -- ‘heart gushingly sweet’) smile of her own. She stood, and slinked over to the edge of the caravan cart, keeping crouched and silent the whole way.</p>
    <p>The Fury gave Barrabus a sideways glance. “Well, that one likes you,” she said mildly.</p>
    <p>“All the ladies of this town like me,” Barrabus said. “And all the men, too. And everyone else. With some notable exceptions, who just envy me and want to be me.”</p>
    <p>Nerilla had made it up the cart’s amber-colored steps, and was now leaning carefully against the door, her left ear lined up against the keyhole.</p>
    <p>“And then there are those that trust me…” he continued.</p>
    <p>The Fury’s face darkened.</p>
    <p>“Not you, Fury,” he said quickly. “I meant--”</p>
    <p>The door to the caravan cart swung inward, revealing a dark room, and a large, bestial arm that looked as if it had been carved from wet grey stone. The paw at the end clamped onto Nerilla’s face before she could even scream, and hauled her kicking into the cart, slamming the door shut behind it.</p>
    <p>“Nerilla!” Barry shouted. </p>
    <p>He charged over to the cart. Within six seconds, he was up to the stairs. Within ten, he had kicked the door open.</p>
    <p>Standing in the middle of the cart was a grey humanoid, taller than a human, with long, almost swordlike claws sticking out of the fingers on each hand. At the moment, the claws on both hands were slicing into Nerilla, effectively having shredded her neck, arms, and stomach. The grey figure had already begun to transform -- Barry could see its skin roil and shift, as Nerilla’s canary-yellow skin and flaxen hair were rolling over the creature’s outsides.</p>
    <p>The beast stared at Barry. Barry stared at the beast.</p>
    <p>“Doppleganger!” Barrabus shouted, pulling his sword free from the sheathe at his side.</p>
    <p>“Barry!” the Fury shouted behind him. “Duck!”</p>
    <p>Barrabus ducked, neatly evading a sweep from the doppleganger’s right hand.</p>
    <p>An arc of whirling technicolor flame leapt over Barrabus’ head, catching the doppleganger in the chest and searing right through it. The creature dropped like a sack of moldy wheat, folding in on itself until it looked more like a pile of clay than a humanoid.</p>
    <p>Barry knelt down to Nerilla, and felt absently for a pulse. There was no chance; he could see that. The creature had killed her before he’d even gotten to the door.</p>
    <p>He glanced up.</p>
    <p>Nailed to one of the walls, like a bad tapestry mounted by an even worse decorator, was most of the skin of Mister Mothleaf.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>“We think the doppleganger was hunting Grasp members,” Stormbadger said. “It kept Mothleaf’s skin so it could keep practicing his likeness. It tore through and then tore up the vast majority of his notes, it looks like, but then left some notes of its own behind. Guess it figured out Fizzaoli was its next target.”</p>
    <p>“Why not take his form then?” Captain Doukas said. “And what the devil happened to his head?”</p>
    <p>“That’s not clear. Plenty of sinkholes out in the Maar, though.” Stormbadger sighed. “I’m guessing this thing caught Mothleaf somewhere out there, disposed of the rest of him, and then came back into town with the important bits in a box. It might have found a corner to drop Fizzaoli’s head in, and then figured Mothleaf was good enough until it realized the assistants had reported in.”</p>
    <p>Doukas nodded. “And what of the stage and equipment?” He shuffled through the parchment pieces on his desk. “I guess the whole of it goes to them? The two assistants, I mean.”</p>
    <p>“They don’t want it,” the inspector said. “Said they’d split off and do their own act. Don’t want anything to do with Fizzaoli at this point.”</p>
    <p>“We’ll sell it then,” Doukas said. “Constabulary auction. Give some of the proceeds to them anyway, to help them start out.”</p>
    <p>Stormbadger nodded. “Yer a soft heart, sir. Real elfitarian.”</p>
    <p>He piled his notebook onto the stool next to him, and checked to make sure the office door was shut. “Now, onto the real problem.”</p>
    <p>Doukas looked up.</p>
    <p>“I think our ol’ friend Lord Barry is trying to woo our ‘most Furious leader’.” </p>
    <p>Doukas winced. “Seriously, inspector? You’re bringing me that gossip shit now?”</p>
    <p>“Think about it, Captain. Think what Barry does when he’s not literally courtin’ fire.”</p>
    <p>Doukas paused. He closed his eyes. “...I’ll put our top elves on it.”</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The door to the restaurant swung closed. Tarps were pulled down over the windows. Lamps inside were rapidly extinguished.</p>
    <p>Light poured from six cloaked figures, seated at the bar. Dozens of plates, bowls, and flagons lay scattered about the bartop, each filled with cheap but flavorful delicacies.</p>
    <p>A seventh figure stepped up, taking the bartender’s position, light pouring from his uncovered hands. “I call this meeting of the Calesteral of East Street to order.”</p>
    <p>“Eat, drink, and be merry,” the other six intoned.</p>
    <p>The bartender paused. “This will be quick; I know we all have much to do. Let’s start with the most important business. Is it done, Ruber?”</p>
    <p>“Oh yes, sirrah,” said Ruber Herringbone. He fished a long, serrated breadknife out from beneath his robes, and placed it delicately onto the table.</p>
    <p>“Serrated, Ruber?” one of the others asked.</p>
    <p>“Its not my preference, I’ll admit, but it leaves nice, rough edges that make it look like the work of animals. And Fizzaoli had dealings with many unsavory characters; I have no doubt the blame will go to them.”</p>
    <p>“And why was it necessary to kill Fizzaoli?” the bartender said, in a tone that stated he already knew the answer.</p>
    <p>“Because, mon ami,” the other six intoned,”foie gras.”</p>
    <p>“The nerve of that damned merchant,” another attendee grumbled. “Stealing secret recipes is bad enough, but taking the secret of birdless foie gras… and then ruining it with knockoff ingredients, and selling it to the Cult of Liberation like a damn street vendor… there are no layers of the Abyss deep enough for his kind.”</p>
    <p>“You’re an angel, Ruber,” said another. “A Solar of Justice.”</p>
    <p>Ruber smiled. “Merely a humble servant. Tea?”</p>
