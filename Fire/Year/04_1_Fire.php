<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves have no problems that aren&rsquo;t already being solved with fire</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Investment): Valkyrie&rsquo;s Aegis [the Smoke]</p>
<p>It seems that the Smoke has been tapped <em>yet again</em> to build defensive fortifications for a brand-new village. All of this would be wearing on her, but compared to hauling around desperate refugees and living in tents, it honestly has been pretty nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disr isn&rsquo;t a normal village, however -- it's the first village that the Fire Elves have ever put onto a mountain (and for that matter, not very many Blade Elf settlements were built directly onto mountains either). This brings with it some interesting new design challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of the ridge that Disr has been built on has been flattened out to support the village in the first place, and the local granite is quite sturdy and highly appropriate for building out of. As such, the Smoke decides that the best way to defend Disr is to clean mountain slopes that don&rsquo;t support the main road, build a short (10&rsquo;) wall around the edge of the plateau, and concentrate most of the defense around a heavy and defensible front gate -- which the designers nickname &ldquo;the Aegis&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): The Hunt for Wolf October [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>Finally, some political capital! Tsun doesn&rsquo;t want to screw this one up -- not this time -- so before she pushes at the Triumvirate and arrests the afflicted Hunger (and drives the Blade Elves from the city, yadda yadda yadda), she has to find evidence. And one strong source of evidence is the palace itself.</p>
<p>With the Triumvirate still in the process of returning from the Potluck, Tsun tasks a few key Praesidium teams with interrogating palace workers and the Constabulary Guard, to hunt down evidence of missing palace employees, and look for any Blade Elf spies planted within either organization. She doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of time to do this, so there&rsquo;s no real chance to thoroughly search the palace for evidence -- instead, the Praesidium must use interrogation, pressure, and external investigation to find out whatever they can.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the process, however, she discovers that <a href="https://greatelfventure.azurewebsites.net/Fire/Bonus/26_Honest Lies.php">Barrabus Leafstorm has bit off a bit more than he can swallow</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=63b5c4b0db600010e7a0a08a48961930">Results</a>: 3 successes <em>(naturally, the Praesidium performs best when its &lsquo;investigating&rsquo; locals)</em></p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Drill): Expansionary Guarding [the Terror]</p>
<p>A new year and a new village means new changes to Surt&rsquo;s military structure, and with the Charred Eagles Milites now an experienced unit with actual action under their belts, it only makes sense to put them in charge of a new Expansionary Guard Unit (hereafter known as Expansionary Guard 2).</p>
<p>The Terror drills that unit&rsquo;s leadership in the basics of managing a division, and orders them to reorganize as the lead of Expansionary Guard 2 (freeing up a slot inside the Charred Eagles). They won&rsquo;t have that celebrated name at their head, but they will gain prime territory as guardians of the new village of Disr.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=66f940b4db600010e7a0a08a48961982">Results</a>: 1 advantage, 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): Gold Fever [the Fury <em>or</em> the Hunger]</p>
<p>Now that Disr&rsquo;s gold deposit is available, the Triumvirate starts to look into what the gold can be used for. For the Hunger, that means currency -- a solid, stable coinage that can replace the old Lycan coins currently in circulation, and provide a base for trade throughout the elven region. But why stop there? Gold isn&rsquo;t just the universal currency because it never tarnishes and is hard to find; it also serves as an important component in artifice and ritual spellwork. Could the currency itself serve as an enhanced spellwork component -- perhaps with the use of some of the alchemical reagents common in Surt? Or could its weight, value, and quality be set in such a way as to serve as a base &ldquo;common minimum value&rdquo; for all thaumaturgical effects, so that any ritual&rsquo;s cost can be counted out in exact Surtian coinage? Could adding reagent values help in defining that value?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hunger gathers the CPC and local alchemists, and starts to work on researching purifying the gold ore coming from Disr, seeing if it can be enhanced with local reagents, and seeing if a base minimum ritual ratio can be defined.</p>
<p>Separately, the Fury gathers her ritual experts together, and examines some of Disr&rsquo;s samples, to see if the gold can be used to enhance the city&rsquo;s ritual casting -- or possibly just provide arcane significance of its own. There&rsquo;s obviously something &ldquo;special&rdquo; about the Marr, and now, clearly, there&rsquo;s something large and&hellip; <em>elemental</em> living under it. And there are clear orange, purplish, or whitish tinges in several of the samples sent back from the mine. Maybe the gold itself can provide an explanation as to what&rsquo;s going on here -- or at least serve as a conduit for enhancing power brought in from the local ley lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between the two of them, enough Surtian resources are gathered together to invoke <em>Empire of the Sun</em>, spending a fate point to provide an <strong>upgrade </strong>to this roll.</p>
<p><em>Two competing ideas! You, GM, decide how to split the results of the roll -- all to the Hunger, all to the Fury, some to each, or force the two to meet in the middle!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=6033c0b0db600010e7a0a08a489619cf">Results</a>: 2 advantage, 1 success <em>(well that was anticlimactic)</em></p>
<p><strong>Character Actions:</strong></p>
<p>Tsun: Arrest the Hunger!</p>
<p>With evidence (hopefully) securely in her grasp, and all of the intel taken from the Wolf Elves in hand, the time has come to arrest the Hunger just as he returns from the Potluck and re-enters Surt. In a public place (i.e. the gatehouse), surrounded by people, and with the <em>hopefully still loyal </em>other members of the Triumvirate right there, there should be no way for the Hunger to escape (or transform and assault them) without it being noticed -- and without therefore ruining any further chance for him to influence Surt. With luck, the Terror will even be willing to execute him right then and there. And once that&rsquo;s done, the Terror and Fury should be willing to remove the Blade Elves that have been allowing the afflicted Hunger&rsquo;s behavior (if not willingly, then by the pressure Tsun knows this sort of information can bring down on them).</p>
<p>There are many, many things about this plan that could go wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of things about this plan that could go absolutely right.</p>
<p>To maximize the chances for the latter, this needs to be as formal, public, and above-board as possible. And this means that Tsun needs to be there, and needs to present the evidence to the Terror or the Fury first, so that they themselves can read it, agree, and assist in the Hunger&rsquo;s removal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, Tsun knows she and her Praesidium escort can fall back and inform the Charred Eagles&rsquo; leadership of the Hunger&rsquo;s traitorous behavior, and then he and the Blade Elves can be driven from Surt by force.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, this will be finished early in the season, leaving Tsun plenty of time to push for a new appointment to the Triumvirate (herself obviously).</p>
<p>Hunger: Needle in an Ashstack</p>
<p>Discussion at the Potluck over methods of affliction has led the Hunger to a very important experiment -- is there a way to detect the presence of the affliction in a water source?</p>
<p>The Hunger has a small number of samples (really need to clean that lab super-super-thoroughly after this), and a small amount of silver. As such&hellip; what happens if he traces the silver, and a bit of wolfsbane, through the &ldquo;sample filter&rdquo; mockup the CPC built way back when the Aqua Via was first under construction, and then passes &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; water through it? Is there a way to design a filter that will turn the water black if it detects tainted material?</p>
<p>This is more of a thought experiment than anything else, but it may become the basis for a project later.</p>
<p>Fury and Terror: Wolf through the Door</p>
<p>The Fury isn&rsquo;t exactly&hellip; comfortable with the Touris-- Bryti wandering around Surt. In fact, she&rsquo;s a little nervous. She recognizes this is really rude and unfair of her, but long years of anti-Lycan sentiment (and anti-werewolf in particular, thanks to a few of Governor Greaseface&rsquo;s friends) don&rsquo;t disappear overnight. Stil, she feels that she owes Bryti something for saving the Hunger&rsquo;s life, and she should probably at least do something as a kind of thank you. Maybe&hellip; some kind of traditional Lycan symbol, or particular to Luna, or something? There are the gold samples from Disr; maybe she can have something forged from those.</p>
<p>This brings up the other concern -- one that she shares with Terror. Hunger hid that he was an afflicted werewolf for <em>two years</em>. What the heck, Hunger? Fury wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily call him a friend, but at least a friendly colleague -- and friendly colleagues shouldn&rsquo;t hide stuff like that! Everyone in Surt was in danger because of him! And if he hadn&rsquo;t been cured, or if he&rsquo;d taken the &ldquo;fake cure&rdquo;, or if he&rsquo;d fully <em>turned</em> -- it would have been a nightmare! The whole town would have suffered!</p>
<p>Terror feels the same way, and is <em>furious</em>. Imagine if he&rsquo;d done something like that during the war! He&rsquo;d agreed to the &ldquo;no exceptions&rdquo; rule back then; he should have stuck with it now. Terror is thankful that he didn&rsquo;t, because he could be cured, but he didn&rsquo;t know that at the time, and clearly only barely made it to what would have been his execution (though at least he was still okay with that -- he hadn&rsquo;t broken the &ldquo;no exceptions&rdquo; rule entirely).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror and Fury both agree that something has to be done about this. Not his removal from office, as he&rsquo;s been essential to keeping Surt afloat, and he <em>is</em> better now. But this sort of thing can&rsquo;t be allowed to happen again, and has to have consequences. Fury and Terror set to work on an&hellip; intervention. A chance to sit him down and tell him off.</p>
<p>In the middle of the second time they&rsquo;ve met for this, the Fury suddenly realizes that this is the first time she and Terror have been interacting with each other regularly in <em>years</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hunger: Landmine</p>
<p>Well, this is just hilarious. Not two minutes back home, and Tsun is trying to arrest you for being a werewolf.</p>
<p>The irony is actually pretty unpleasant; its like licking an electric wire. And that makes the shocking evidence she&rsquo;s presenting all the more interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re standing there, reading over some of Tsun&rsquo;s evidence papers, while the Ashwalker herself gets into a loud and increasingly vitriolic argument with Katya (best to keep to that name for now) over your arrest warrant (again, painful irony). All of the papers report to be from &ldquo;the palace&rdquo;, though they&rsquo;re bound together in a folder marked &ldquo;Evidence recovered from suspected wolf elf spy, KDE&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite her brash tendencies, Tsun is thorough, and tends to make her moves at least partially above board -- she&rsquo;s interested in legitimately, not illegitimately, seizing control, or &ldquo;fighting outside influence&rdquo;, or whatever she&rsquo;s calling it this week. So the outside folder is likely accurate, and &ldquo;KDE&rdquo;, or killed during encounter, suggests that the spy in question could easily have been a dupe sent to get killed while carrying a batch of dummy intel. And given that according to this intel you consumed at least three babies and tore apart several &ldquo;lab assistants&rdquo; you&rsquo;re pretty sure you&rsquo;ve never heard of (not to mention <em>you don&rsquo;t have lab assistants</em>), this is clearly dummy intel.</p>
<p>Tsun must be aware of this. Either she&rsquo;s already turned -- but then why the arrest? Either you would already be on their side, or they&rsquo;d be better served smuggling you out or killing you silently -- or she&rsquo;s aware the intel is questionable, but is too tempting not to try. Or this is a pretext to killing you, but then Tsun&rsquo;s insistence on a public arrest, and shouting match with Katya, would make your death very public and extremely embarrassing for her. Unlikely.</p>
<p>This also means the Wolf Elves wanted to catch you coming and going. Why? ...To cause internal strife if you died at the potluck, and were declared afflicted. The evidence is flimsy, but that hardly matters if the accusation was already proven true. Clever move on their part, but then why offer the cure? Sentiment wasn&rsquo;t exactly Cantia&rsquo;s thing. And if they assumed you would be killed anyway -- the Tourist was pretty clear on that mark -- then why not just let it happen? To force you to hurry up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or because they assumed the Tourist would not kill you if you were cured.</p>
<p>And then, with you arrested, they could easily smuggle you out of Surt -- or offer you the chance to turn in exchange for restoration of your power.</p>
<p>You smile to yourself. Such arrogance. You can use that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Traditional jail is too insecure, and leaves the question of your guilt a little too open. House arrest, on the other hand, allows you to set the stage, and is easily justified by the idea that you are being monitored to make sure you aren&rsquo;t alchemically hiding the transformation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You chafe at the thought of being cooped up in the villa. Plus, you were planning on lending it to &lsquo;Katya&rsquo; for her vacation. Well&hellip; it can still mostly be hers. You&rsquo;ll just be occupying one of the rooms for a while. Maybe have some of your work brought over to you; this is a good time to consider anti-affliction filter options and technical research concepts anyway, and no part of &lsquo;house arrest&rsquo; says you can&rsquo;t invite a few friends (or the whole CPC) over.</p>
<p>And certainly, Katya would probably enjoy an ambush-revenge plan. As would Tsun, once she&rsquo;s aware of how much this relied on her being duped; you suppose it might be time to &lsquo;clue her in&rsquo; on a few important Wolf Elf details (maybe even your battle with affliction -- it&rsquo;ll keep her interested, and probably hopeful that she can remove you later). Allophryne would probably be interested, though it's hard to tell. Terror as well, and Fury, though you suppose that means you might have some apologizing to do during this.</p>
<p>A simple plan -- Praesidium guards inside and outside the villa, with Terror and Katya on rotating shifts, and regular &ldquo;file pulls&rdquo; from the Palace to cover their entrances and exits. Tsun, Fury, and Allophryne on site when available, with similar entrance and exit plans. And you, of course, working in an enclosed office, ready and waiting to be &ldquo;rescued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And publicly? You&rsquo;re &lsquo;suspected&rsquo; of being afflicted, but have passed all of the normal tests (which you will, because you&rsquo;re <em>not</em>. Isn&rsquo;t that a nice feeling?). Tsun, however, has demanded that you remain under house arrest at least through the next few full moons, to prove that you&rsquo;re not hiding it with alchemy.</p>
<p>You suddenly notice that the loud argument has ceased, and Tsun and Katya have been staring at you with awkward concern for several seconds. Umm. Shoot. How to recover from this. Ah, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, offend both parties. Classy. </p>
<p><strong>End of Turn&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3>Summer Year 4 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>Despite the rest of the shenanigans going on in fire elf territory, the framework that Hunger laid out with the CPC in expectation of his own demise is actually working. It's some comfort to the Hunger to know he was right. They stay out of politics, keep their heads down, and get the job done.</p>
<p>The Aegis is constructed on time and within budget, and with hardly a peep. Even though the Expansionary Guard division they were promised is running late (more on that in a bit,) they have enough Civil Guard on hand to man the defenses in a pinch. With Disr's natural defenses, it doesn't take a huge force to protect the settlement - then again, there's a lot to protect. First reports as the mine is getting underway indicate that it is quite productive.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>For both Tsun and the Hunger, the investigation turns out to be a wildly mixed bag. The Praesidium's investigation into the strange goings-on in the palace does indeed produce concrete results, but they are odd and almost contradictory.</p>
<p>Good for Hunger/Bad for Tsun:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no provable evidence that Hunger is afflicted, and evidence that he ever was is largely circumstantial.</li>
<li>There are definitely not any blade elf spies lurking around.</li>
<li>Many of the "missing persons" noted are found to either not exist or be just fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good for Tsun/Bad for Hunger:</p>
<ul>
<li>There <em>is</em> circumstantial evidence that Hunger was afflicted: most notably, his long disappearances always line up with the full moon. This is enough to make people suspicious.</li>
<li>There <em>are</em> people actually missing. Not many, and oddly not people that are longtime staff. The actual missing people are mostly newcomers, refugees who only recently entered Surt - and as Tsun notes, would be the least missed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally and most shockingly, while tracking down one of the people listed as missing, Praesidium investigators find that the individual in question - one Marius Sweetwater - has been locked in his home for months and only been accepting food delivered at the back door in the dead of night.</p>
<p>A combines Praesidium and CG team investigate the house to find it apparently abandoned. They force entry, only to shockingly come under attack by an emaciated afflicted werewolf.</p>
<p>Thankfully the team is able to kill the wretched thing without anyone being killed or afflicted. Marius appears to have boarded himself up in his home and was slowly starving, so even as a werewolf he was weakened. The news of a confirmed afflicted inside the city shocks Surt and reinvigorates the faltering trial. <em>Someone </em>afflicted this poor individual, and Tsun thinks it was Hunger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hunger is able to show that he does not transform on a full moon and passes the alchemical test, but Tsun argues that he pioneered the alchemical test and may have found a way to suppress the transformation. With so much fear flying around, many people are fixating on the only target they have available, the Hunger. The trial continues.</p>
<p><br />Seee <strong>Event: </strong>Hunger's Trial below.</p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> At it turns out, people are a bit exhausted from the last war for a recruitment drive to work right now. Especially for the Milites. When the first group was recruited, they <em>were not</em> expecting to be deployed for over a year in the middle of the friggin&rsquo; desert almost right off the bat. With the Charred Eagles having spent so long from home, they are currently mostly working on reintegrating with local command structures and getting all that blade elf stuff out of their barracks. Motivating them to redeploy <em>already</em> ends up feeling like trying to motivate a brick wall.</p>
<p>So, frustration on frustration, Terror is unable to get anything moving this season. Though fears of wolf elves are high, fear of Terror shredding off for the nearest killing field she can find is <em>also </em>high. Aside from Terror&rsquo;s frustration, talk of reorganization and redeploy so soon takes a toll on morale. The existing Milites in the Charred Eagles have <em>Low Morale.</em> Only for one season, though. They&rsquo;ll get over it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and the Chevaliers have recovered from their casualties. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>Initial examination of the gold from Disr is quite interesting. It appears that a variety of impurities exist in this gold vein. It's not enough to lower the value, but it <em>is</em> enough that the gold comes in an interesting variety of colors - with the most common being a very slight red-orange tint. Hunger is able to track down the impurities as a variety of the alchemical reagents common in the maar along with, quite interestingly, elements from the plane of fire.</p>
<p>One of the unexpected benefits of this is that it will be almost impossible to counterfeit Surtian coinage. The exact proportions of materials needed to duplicate the particular color is extremely specific, and doesn't match any other gold samples Hunger has.</p>
<p>As far as using the coins in magic, well, it's possible. Hunger and Fury end up sort of stretching the project both ways, but with access to all of her materials Fury has the advantage here.</p>
<p>She finds that there is indeed a connection between the elements in the gold and the maar itself, meaning whatever nasty she bumped into last year is likely connected to the plane of fire, not hell&hellip; so, that's good she guesses. The gold is connected to the maar itself and theoretically the ley lines. It may be possible to use the gold to enhance ritual casting if it's a spell interconnected with the Maar. Fury has an <strong>Upgrade </strong>on any future checks to pursue that line of research.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Hunger</strong> isn't able to work out a way to make the water itself turn black, but getting the filters themselves to do so if exposed to the affliction is quite possible. It'll require a Nations level Creation check to do so at scale, though, as the filters will require regular refreshing and checking on.</p>
<p><strong>Bryti's </strong>"Katya" identity comes under intense scrutiny during the investigation. She is only narrowly able to avoid her identity being revealed during a Praesidium questioning. She is extremely reluctant to leave with confirmed afflicted in the area, but if her real identity is discovered even by accident it would have massive negative consequences for her, the Triumvirate, and Ehra whose signature on her paperwork is genuine. The decision is reached that it is safest for everyone if she leaves Surt.</p>
<p>She maintains that she has the feather. If there are any more confirmed cases of the Affliction, she will arrive as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Event- </strong>The Hunger's Trial</p>
<p><strong>Status- </strong>Ongoing</p>
<p><strong>Effect- </strong>1 point of Morale stress per turn (starting now,) <em>Praesidium </em>cannot be invoked, Hunger under house arrest.</p>
<p>This isn't as bad as the last time Tsun riled up the Praesidium. They are actually doing their duty. It's just that their duty makes them still highly suspicious of the Hunger.</p>
<p>While Tsun's hopes for an immediate and conclusive trial are shattered, the discovery of actually missing persons and one confirmed afflicted even tenuously connected to Hunger by evidence is enough to keep the trial going and keep Hunger under house arrest.</p>
<p>Surt is doing its best to keep things moving, but the shocking news of an afflicted in Surt and a member of the Triumvirate suspected of the deed has people worried. <em>Very</em> worried.</p>
<p>There is a small bright spot. A small group of Praesidium officers from more moderate factions breaks ranks and meets with the Triumvirate in secret. They feel like something is up. Tsun is playing her cards <em>extremely </em>close to the chest. She is only sharing information with her most loyal followers. Most Praesidium members were convinced Hunger was clean until the afflicted was discovered, and many still are. Some of the more wily members of the Praesidium feel that something doesn't add up about this chain of events. They are willing to take risks to help discover the truth.</p>
