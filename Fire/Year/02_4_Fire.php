<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves are likely to have many problems in the future, but most of them haven&rsquo;t actually happened yet, so we&rsquo;ll just pretend they&rsquo;re safe for now</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Establishment): Fireport [the Hunger]</p>
<p>Action: Create village &lsquo;Gerdr&rsquo; two squares south of Surt</p>
<p>Even with the ongoing potential Turmoil, Surt needs to expand, and letting unseen threats hem it in is not really an option. Particularly if Surt is to keep up with its neighbors (friendly or not). To that end, the Hunger pushes forward Project Gerdr, an expansion settlement in the newly discovered cove [two squares] to Surt&rsquo;s south. A complete port will have to wait until the settlement itself is established, but for now this should provide a decent base of operations for newcomers heading into Surt&rsquo;s established territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an internal vote within the CPC, the new village is named Gerdr. As with Surt, the name is taken from old Elven mythology (as remembered after years under the Lycans).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the Expansionary Guard will be sent out to defend the site during and after construction. This should also help provide incoming guests a safe port to dock at on their way to the Potluck.</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Be prepared [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p><em>Includes a Prof die from Cathartic Unity</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to be serious about this, Tsun. It is extremely likely that Surt will be the target of enemy activity this season. For all that you said about &ldquo;stupid bureaucrats&rdquo;, you and I *and the public* know that there was a serious security breach at the filter stations this past winter, and you and I are both aware that Alfyr suffered a similar breach. Someone is setting us up.<br /> &ldquo;I know you have complaints about the Blade Elf presence here, and I&rsquo;ll give you a chance to address them. But that requires there *is* a Surt at the end of this. Keep your troops off the Blade Elves and on the actual policework. Catch something for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Conventional Warfare (Defensive Operations): Abundant Force [the Terror]</p>
<p>Conditional action: Deploy detachment Charred Eagles to support Dreamdust anti-Coyote operations</p>
<p>After a long-distance discussion with the Flying Elves, the Dreamdust Elves, and the Blade Elves, the Terror takes the Charred Eagles division southwards, and deploys them in defensive operations in support of the Dreamdust Elves. The Terror&rsquo;s campaign goal is to see the &lsquo;Coyotes&rsquo; at least deterred, with preference for dragging them into at least one engagement; the Coyote strategy appears to be &lsquo;fast raids on soft targets&rsquo;, which suggests that even small losses may deter them from future assaults.</p>
<p>Part one of the Terror&rsquo;s strategy will be to help the Dreamdust elves build more serious defenses in their area (including spike walls, trenches, and other cavalry-counters), and make an effort to study up on known Coyote battle tactics (including talking with the local kobold(?) tribes that live in the area). Part two will be a coordinated effort to detect the next raid before it arrives and force an engagement; this will likely mean setting up a bait convoy, but that&rsquo;s not required if the enemy makes their intentions clear from the start. Part three will be to take captives and try to figure out Coyote situation and grand strategy, and to force capitulance if possible.</p>

<p><strong>Military Action 2 (motivating with 1 FP):</strong></p>
<p>Conventional Warfare (Defensive Operations): Redundant Force [the Smoke]</p>
<p>Action: deploy the Expansionary Guard to the site of Gerdr</p>
<p><em>Stunt invoked: </em><strong><em>Hot Gates!</em></strong></p>
<p>The likelihood of enemy action at this juncture is dangerously high. Vita, who is effectively the city&rsquo;s top general after the Terror, is ordered to deploy the Expansionary Guard to the site of Gerdr, and prepare to defend it from possible incursion. Aware that the settlement is a precarious position, and the Expansionary Guard is a green unit, the Smoke keeps the civilians prepped for an evacuation, and has the Guard defend the road where possible, with orders to retry to Surt if they are likely to be overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Smoke decides that some of these operations should take advantage of the cove and the village currently being built -- including village buildings in fortification planning, preparing the road for sapping, etc. The infrastructure damage may hurt Gerdr in the short term, but it&rsquo;ll also make it that much harder for an enemy force to invade.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): the Ill Intent [the Fury]</p>
<p>Well, this &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; that Shadimon provided looks promising&hellip; even though, to the Fury, its about straightforward and easy to interpret as a romance novel written in draconic. What&rsquo;s more, it seems somewhat limited -- a random duration, lasting between a single season and a year? Based solely on intent to do harm? There&rsquo;s potential there, but by itself it is somewhat limited, and likely to force the ritual casters to cast it every other season just to keep it from dropping unannounced. So, she decides, why not improve upon it, using this as a basis?</p>
<p>She starts by doing some retargeting. &ldquo;The settlement&rdquo; is a good target, but &ldquo;anyone intending to do harm on the settlement or its occupants&rdquo; is vague and likely to lead to false positives. Narrowing it to &ldquo;individuals obscuring themselves with illusion, transmutation, or polymorph effects, with intent to do harm to two or more individuals, and/or an individual on &lsquo;list of government officials&rdquo; makes for a more complicated search query, but also means the spell only queries magical auras first, and *then* thoughts on the subset, which should reduce the overall energy costs of the spell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, she attempts to extend the ritual by one or more seasons automatically, or at least to a minimum of two seasons and a maximum of four (i.e. 1d3+1).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perception 11, Craft (Alchemy) 3`</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action 2:</strong></p>
<p>Screw the dog&rsquo;s &ldquo;noble intentions&rdquo;. The Hunger knows that it has to know that if they are the same, then were their positions reversed, it would decide that it cannot take the risk that the Hunger would represent. To that end, the Hunger delves into arcane research, attempting to devise an &ldquo;arcane lock&rdquo; variant that will function on a timer. The goal is to create a magically enhanced locking mechanism that even he can&rsquo;t open once its active, and will deactivate after nine hours. If that works, he&rsquo;ll test it on the doorway to the lab -- and add a copy to the cell door once he&rsquo;s certain its solid.</p>
<p>Know (Arcana): 28</p>
<p>He also leaves a few bottles of wine in the cell. If the creature wishes to drink, why not indulge him.</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action 3:</strong></p>
<p>(A) The transformation has an active casting aura associated with it. (B). The dog insists its mind is the same, but without morality&hellip; which probably indicates it would fall on the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; axis on the philosopher-alchemist Milgram&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moral Alignment Square&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going off of that, the Hunger wonders if it might be possible to at least &ldquo;alleviate&rdquo; the beast with some sort of &ldquo;alignment inducement&rdquo; -- or that maybe a simple <em>protection from evil</em> potion will ameliorate some of the symptoms. This has enough merit that the Hunger resolves to try that before the next full moon. And if the dog has complaints about this procedure, it should remember that morality and ethics are an important part of blending in with the public. So shut up.</p>
<p>Dispelling is another question&hellip; but is also harder to pull off, as that usually requires direct (and significant) arcane or divine release. However, there are devices that can store this energy, and in fact, there is one in particular that might be well-suited. The Hunger sets to work on modifying a <em>Bead of Newt Prevention</em>, with the goal of tweaking its function so that it would temporarily prevent the curse&rsquo;s transformative effects. Even if this only buys a few minutes, it could literally make the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Knowledge (Arcana): 28</p>
<p><strong>Barrabus Action 1:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the strong suggestions of *certain people* who seem to think that Barry can find the River Elves&rsquo; secret winter quarters *and* save them in a span of a week, Barry determines that the best use of the remainder of the season is to <em>try and figure out what the hell is going on with the Triumvirate</em>. He understands that there are a lot of external threats going on right now, which is probably taking a lot of their attention, but there&rsquo;s been something very strange going on with those three for the last season, at least. The Hunger keeps being &ldquo;mysteriously absent&rdquo;. The Fury started doing something similar last season (and there&rsquo;s definitely something up with her, but Barry figures a lot of that is just that she&rsquo;s crazy). And now the Terror disappears for a week, only to immediately take the Charred Eagles and head south almost as soon as she got back. What the hell is going on?</p>

<p id="DogLetter">It's think tank not thinktank.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">Thank you for the wine. I will endeavor to allow us both to savor it. It is good to see we can both be civil.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">Speaking of, allow me to assuage your concerns. First of all, I am you means if you get beheaded for being a werewolf, I get beheaded for being a werewolf. Like you, I have no desire to die. That alone is reason enough for me to understand our need for secrecy.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">More importantly, I also appear to have your drive and intelligence. I have no idea to prowl the streets as a beast and take prey as I desire. That's so trite and pedantic. No, like I said your deepest innermost desires are far more lofty and ambiguous. That is what makes us special.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">I have those crude animal instincts that the Lycans talk about overwhelming your mind, but in our case it appears to be different. I apply my instincts with your intellect. I believe this may give us an edge. After all, recent events show that our backs are to a wall. Can you really afford to give up an extra set of eyes? A version of your brilliance, with added insight and instinct, working on your problems while you cannot?</p>
<p id="DogLetter">I will agree to stay in the "think tank" and work on our problems instead of trying to escape or overwhelm you on one condition: Give me the tools I need to work. After all, how much could you accomplish if just starting at a concrete wall? I would prefer the whole lab, but even limited access to our notes would help.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">As a proof of concept, during our last transformation, I spent some time going over our project notes for the new settlement at Gedr. I wrote down some ideas for setting up one of our purification systems in the cove itself. This would make the water much more palatable to the river elves, and make them far more receptive to trading with us. You should take a look.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">Take your time deciding, but remember: Whoever this is trying to pull us apart, they are not being patient.</p>

<p>Hunger:</p>

<p id="HungerLetter">Predictive logic exercise. Outside forces, designated 'wolf elves', have struck at here and Alfyr, and potentially engineered assault on Dreamdust elves. This suggests they're targeting weaknesses (our security, Dreamdusts' military), and if so, are probably doing so to open an opportunity for further action. On the one hand, if this is a feint, it would be traditional to hit a fourth target while 3 of the allied states are busy. On the other, this also opens up a potential military maneuver (with both military-inclined groups hit *and* one supporting the Dreamdust elves), which could allow them to move against Surt or Alfyr while they're both weakened and unlikely to act. What would you predict for their next move? Let's see if it lines up with mine.</p>
</td>

<p>Dog:</p>
</td>

<p id="DogLetter">Ah, I see. I agree, it is quite suspicious that so much widespread chaos is happening all at once. Specifically, what I predict is that what I predict is irrelevant. We must prepare for the worst case scenario, that being that all of these events are indeed related, and a product of enemy action. In that case, I agree with the course of action taken. It leaves multiple openings covered, but more importantly is decisive. Dithering about perfect solutions creates an opening, and choice paralysis makes you a target. While it does indeed leave us open for a direct, focused attack on Surt or Alfyr, neither are undefended or unprepared. If either is subject to a coordinated military attack, we will be hampered in our response but less so than if we left a location completely undefended.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">As far as what I predict, what I actually believe is going to happen&hellip; Allow my animal instinct to speak. The Coyotes are opportunistic predators. Scavengers. They have been seen observing targets for quite some time. There was a valuable target - the merchant shipment - that was undefended and in the open. They hit it and ran. Like the Coyotes they name themselves after, they take what is easiest and flee. I believe they will not continue to engage, but instead either hide or seek out a new target.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">I think the Coyotes are an independent actor working solely for their own gain. Whether or not they are connected to the wolf elves is unknown. They did somehow know where and when to find the shipment. The wolf elves seem to be playing a longer game, though. I am not sure what they are getting at, but they are definitely not bandits or thieves. If these two factions are cooperating, it&rsquo;s probably tenuous at best.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">So, the Coyotes are not going to attack us, unless something profitable is left vulnerable. The wolf elves, however, may take advantage of how spread thin our forces are. I am not sure what they want, but given they disguise themselves they clearly are trying to formulate mistrust.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">The most likely action we will suffer is an attempt to sabotage the upcoming Potluck. We should keep our eyes there. We need to learn what the wolf elves want, or we will be forever on our back paws.</p>

<p id="HungerLetter">So what exactly are you &ldquo;free&rdquo; from?

</td>

<p>Dog:</p>
</td>

<p id="DogLetter">You seem to misunderstand me. The shackles I am free of include the tedious morality you surround yourself with, yes. It also includes the thick layer of lies you tell yourself about your own nature. You always seek a subservient position because you fear responsibility for your actions. Not that you do not take responsibility for your actions, but rather that you take too much. You fear making the big, unguided decisions. You always want someone like the Terror or Goldheart above you, so that if the whole ship runs aground it&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">But I digress. I do not argue that morality is a weakness for all living beings, and that society is better off without it. I argue that&nbsp;<strong>we</strong>&nbsp;are better off without it. Let the common riffraff, the fools and those that lack vision, look to the gods for guidance. It makes them easier to account for. Those of us who have the brilliance to see the world with clarity can discard such illusions and act freely, to support the outcomes that we desire. People like this have always guided society, and I believe we are such an individual.</p>
<p id="DogLetter">This brings me to my central argument. You want me to demonstrate why my unfettered viewpoint can be an asset in bringing Surt and the fire elves to ascendancy? Allow me to make a case for something you refuse to let yourself consider:</p>

<p id="DogLetter">The Fury can&rsquo;t control them anyway. If Tsun died, some equally irritating Ashen would take over yes. They would also likely be a less infuriatingly competent Ashen. What makes Tsun dangerous is the fact that she is both extremely good at what she does and absolutely does not think about the long term consequences of her actions. This is an extremely dangerous combination.</p>
  <p id="DogLetter">
    Tsun does what she thinks is best for her and her particular view of the Ashen. This is the only factor she thinks about, and only in the short term. She is also very good at swaying people to her side and stirring them to action. Look how she dug in her heels about the wolf elves, how she took a shot at Ehra just because she could. She thinks emotionally, not logically. She lashes out at things that come from sources she hates, and likely easily accepts information that confirms her biases. With someone like that at the head of a movement like the Ashen, and able to command such loyalty and manipulate people so well, it is only a matter of time before she does something that permanently damages Surt’s future.
  </p>
<p id="DogLetter">If she dies, they&rsquo;ll have a martyr yes. Hopefully we can kill her in a way that looks like an accident, or is at least plausibly deniable. Maybe we could frame the wolf elves. At any rate, the most important factor is this:</p>
<p id="DogLetter">A martyr is only as good as their followers. Without Tsun, the Ashen are rudderless and incompetent. This makes them far less of a wild card to deal with.</p>

<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>Congratulations! The settlement of Gedr has been founded!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Gedr&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Up to you</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: Village</li>
<li><strong>Territory Aspects</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Volcanic Badlands</strong>: The terrain around Gedr is the same as the rest of the dangerous, unstable terrain around the Maar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sheltered Cove:</strong> Gedr exists atop a very large slab of granite, surrounded by several granite ridges that extend into the Maar itself. This makes the ground that Gedr is built on a bit more stable than the rest of the Maar, as well as providing some amount of shelter from the harsh air and water in the area.</li>
<li><strong>Settlement Aspects</strong>
<ul>
<li>Empty Slot</li>
<li>Empty Slot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Garrison</strong>: Occupied by Expansionary Guard</li>
</ul>
<p>The construction process for Gedr goes smoothly. There is some initial headbutting, with CPC construction teams and the Expansionary Guard arguing about what specific projects take priority versus security, but Smoke is able to keep things running smoothly.</p>
<p>In fact, the biggest problem with the founding of Gedr is that it ends up being <em>more</em> successful than anticipated. A large group of immigrants arrive from the Hilt&rsquo;Inn. They report that they had been staying at the refugee center there until the harsh winter cleared and they were able to travel. Many of them settle in Gedr. Additionally, many merchants who wish to trade with the outside world move large portions of their businesses to Gedr, and finally a large number of people who are just sick of the fractured politics in Surt move as well. Gedr ends up with a larger than anticipated population.</p>
<p>Gedr&rsquo;s population is mostly more sedate and businesslike fire elves, those than want a place to just simply do business in a slightly more stable area than the chaotic swirl of nonsense that is Surt.</p>
<p>The higher population places a toll on your building supplies. Once again, you&rsquo;ve gone a bit over budget. Nothing catastrophic though, you will simply take a <strong>setback die</strong> on any Infrastructure checks next turn.</p>
<p>Gedr is well ready to receive guests by the time of the Potluck, as well. A few basic docks are built, but nothing fancy. It&rsquo;ll work though, especially with the natural shelter of the cove.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Asking the dark elves for a little help turns out to have been a good idea. Their spyhunters are few in number, but they have skills that the CG and Praesidium don't, namely subtlety. The CG act like traditional guards, and the Praesidium mostly rely on numbers, coverage, and local connections. Neither of them are particularly sneaky, sly types.</p>
<p>This means that the dark elves have a neat little niche to fill. They stay in the background mostly, staying hidden, watching, and listening. They are more than happy to stay out of the spotlight with how chaotic and vibrant Surt is. Turns out, watching from the shadows helps.</p>
<p>Doukas' idea to have CG escorts with the blade elves turns out to be an effective one. The blades complain about their "babysitters," especially at the beginning, but the impromptu guides keep the blade elves from having misunderstandings with the locals. However, this gets dicey in crowded situations. It is on one such occasion during a particularly busy night at the Howl that someone tries to make their move.</p>
<p>Another bar fight distracts the guards. A few insulting words make it to the ears of a group of five blade elf soldiers. Before anyone can account for it, they're ready to take it outside. Right into the waiting arms of a more extremist Praesidium patrol, in a clear alley, with lookouts on the ends</p>
<p>They did not count on the dark elves. A dark elf Spyhunter watching the outside of the Howl recognizes a trap when he sees one. The dark elf can't make it inside because of the crowd, but manages to reach a passing CG patrol in time. The CG makes it to the alley in time, stopping the group before they ambush the blade elves. All are arrested.</p>
<p>The CG and Spyhunters agree that this group was intentionally looking to start an incident that would end up with dead blade elves (or maybe fire elves dead at blade elf hands) and perhaps put a permanent black mark on the two peoples' relationship. Thankfully this has been avoided. The blade elves spend a few days in lockup and receive disciplinary action from Villhook for getting drunk while armed, knowingly getting in a fight, and leaving their mandatory escort behind. A couple of officers in the group are demoted and sent home. The Praesidium members responsible for the plan are taken into Triumvirate custody.</p>
<p>They turn out to be from a tiny extremist sect called the Blue Flame. The group seems to believe that fire elves have even further to go before reaching their true destiny as "perfect flame," whatever the fuck that means. The group measured less than ten, and this represented all their Praesidium members. Considering their leaders fled Surt as soon as the ambush failed, your analysts believe that they may have had outside help.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that's the only major incident with the blade elves. There are a litany of smaller clashes, but far from anything serious. By the end of the season, the majority of non-extremist blade elves are satisfied that the blade elves are genuinely there to help and not to invade.</p>
<p>They're shit at lying anyway.</p>
<h3 id="back">Roleplay Event 2.4.1: <a href="../Bonus/9_A Blade's Edge.php">A Blade's Edge</a></h3>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> The Coyotes are absolutely infuriating to fight, but fight them you do.</p>
<p>The opening weeks of your joint deployment are marked with nigh constant harassing raids, feints, and sabotage. Coyotes come in small groups at random times, harass supply trains, fake charges, and just generally cause trouble. None of these end up being an actual attack, but it gets aggravating.</p>
<p><br />Damage from this is of course limited. The Charred Eagles do a good job of keeping them away from anything actually important. The winged elf rangers also prove absolute masters of their craft as well. Even though they have well more than a hundred miles of territory to cover throughout the season, they do so with extreme prejudice. More often than not, you have warning that a Coyote harassing attack is coming and are able to react and close ranks.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, actually <em>pinning down</em> the Coyotes when they&rsquo;re doing one of these raids proves nearly impossible. Over the course of the raids, you get an idea of just how fast the Coyote elf horses are - with a move speed of about 80 in game terms. Even winged elf scouts can&rsquo;t keep up with that nonsense, and tracking them once they manage to shake visual contact proves nearly impossible. Their habit of using small hills as cover and kicking up small dust storms makes this even worse, allowing them to break contact from even aerial pursuit. People should not be that stealthy on horseback. It should not be legal.</p>
<p>Still, the worst casualty of this phase is the exhaustion. Many of the troops are not used to functioning in this hot of an environment with this aggressive of an operations tempo. It proves taxing on the troops constantly scrambling for raids, and eventually they have had enough. Dust proposes a daring plan and Shadimon and Terror agree, though Shadimon goes to attempt to deliver an ultimatum of some kind to the Coyotes first.</p>
<p>Regardless, a plan like this has a narrow window of opportunity. The fire elves and dreamdust elves cooperate to rig the ambush caravan. The dreamdust elves are a little antsy about setting so many things up to burn, but the fire elves are <em>pumped</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparently undefended caravan is sent out. Winged elf rangers spread out to watch for an attack. Dreamdust elves prepare for an ambush and to set the fires. Fire elves prepare for what fire elves do. The Terror is practically vibrating.</p>
<p>The attack comes suddenly, with the Coyotes coming straight at the caravan at full gallop. This attack is not as coordinated as the others, with instead the Coyotes attacking in a massive formation that runs at the head of another massive dust storm. You can see banners with Coyotes embroidered at them flying among the cavalry charge. You may have underestimated them.</p>
<p>They hit the caravan in a ragged formation. Dreamdust elves leap from the wagons, apparently fleeing the attack and leaving the caravan unattended. Coyotes rip open the covers of the wagons to find&hellip; <em>fire.</em> Honestly it&rsquo;s a perfect setup. It could not have gone closer to plan.</p>
<p>The fire elves erupt from the flames. The Terror, in a blur of fire and chain, leaps from the cart and takes charge of the battlefield. With the shock of erupting flames and close combat with anti-cavalry soldiers, the Coyotes are thrown into disarray.</p>
<p>The Terror and her hoplites surround a group of Coyotes - about ten. They call for the Coyotes to dismount and surrender.</p>
<p>One of the Coyotes yells in response: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get my head off my shoulders before my ass off my horse, pendeja!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The defiant Coyote then whistles and rallies the remaining riders to him. The trapped Coyote riders then proceed to charge the Terror. Not the Elect surrounding her, not in a breakout. They charge <em>her personally</em>. All ten of them.</p>
<p>Terror, with the help of her Elect, is able to survive the attack and still be standing. Most of the trapped Coyotes are killed. Two escape on horseback. Three horses are captured, along with the Coyote who yelled to start the attack. Terror appears to have gone out of her way to leave that guy alive, and he disappears into fire elf custody.</p>
<p>The remaining Coyotes retreat from the attack in disarray. They do organize and pull their usual disappearing act, but the winged elves notice something off. There are significantly fewer Coyotes than they thought. They appear to be riding in a loose formation, specifically intended to make it look like there are more of them than there actually are.</p>
<p>After conferring with the assembled military leaders, the cause is clear. This is a distraction. The Coyotes want you to think that they have a full division active in this region, when clearly they do not. If the division that attacked the nomads isn&rsquo;t here though, where are they?</p>
<p>Oh. Oh no.</p>
<p><em>To: All; From: Baijani: Asavardi under attack by Coyote elves. Casualties, hostages, looting in progress. No assistance expected now, but revenge would be lovely. Fuckem.</em></p>
<p>Baijani is right. There&rsquo;s no way you could reach Asavardi in time.</p>
<p>Worse news comes back. The scout that travelled with Shadimon returns, alone and injured. By apparently sheer horrifically bad luck, Shadimon was shot down. The scout last saw Shadimon getting a net thrown over him and dragged to the ground by Coyote riders at Coldwater. He has been captured.</p>
<p><em>Though they did serious damage to the attacking Coyotes, your Division was under significant stress keeping up with the Coyotes constant raids. They have the Fatigued condition until the end of Summer. The Ashkin who were already fatigued are Exhausted.</em></p>
<p><em>Notably you have the defiant Coyote captive. However, getting brained by Terror&rsquo;s hammer has left him worse for wear. Even after magic healing, he is down unconscious with a fever. Healers tell you that forcing him to regain consciousness might permanently damage his mind or kill him. What you do with him is up to you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>As it turns out, the winged elves are <em>extremely</em> good at detail oriented magic, and this is not exactly the Fury&rsquo;s forte. At first glance of the pages describing the ritual, she assumes this will not be a big deal. The raw magical power needed to fuel this ritual is not particularly great, nor is there anything particularly catastrophic that could go wrong. The devils, however, hide in the details.</p>
<p>The Fury assumes she will be able to knock back this ritual no problem. After reading the overall description of the ritual, she believes it will be easy enough to research and begins to add her own little improvements to the ritual itself. As it turns out, this was a mistake.</p>
<p>While it may not be a particularly powerful ritual, it <em>is</em> a particularly complicated one. This spell involves multiple different types of divination magic, as well as abjuration. Each of these different types of magic weave together, relying on each other to make the ritual function. These factors combine to make this ritual actually rather difficult to adapt to her particular casting style.</p>
<p>If she had simply been trying to copy it and started that way, she may have succeeded. However her self confident belief in her abilities led her to add many difficult and complicated additions to the spell. She loses too much time trying to implement these improvements with the original ritual, and ends up simply running out of time without a viable version of the ritual ready.</p>
<p><strong>Characters-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smoke- </strong>The site has been here for some time. Most of the tracks are old and worn down. The ridge and the cave in particular, however, are sheltered and not worn nearly as much. She isn&rsquo;t able to get as much as she really wanted, but she&rsquo;s able to get some solid information.</p>
<p>The most conclusive thing she&rsquo;s able to figure out is that there was only one individual in the cave. There are boot and pawprints, but they were both from the same individual. There&rsquo;s one print where someone was clearly in mid-shapeshift. Further, with her knowledge of tracking, she&rsquo;s reasonably certain that this was a large female wolf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wolf was badly injured when she entered the cave. Smoke <em>thinks</em> the wolf may have been coming <em>from</em> the direction of Surt, not towards it. The wolf was limping with what was definitely a broken leg, and probably numerous other injuries. She stopped, laid down, and bled from numerous injuries for a bit. She shifted into humanoid form, then back into wolf. The wolf tracks leaving the cave are not injured, so Smoke suspects the wolf may have used some kind of magic healing as a humanoid then shifted back to wolf.</p>
<p>The wolf then left the cave and headed towards the overlook that the Terror stayed at. It&rsquo;s kind of hard to make out any kind of tracks on the rock, so after that it&rsquo;s not clear. It&rsquo;s hard to tell because of the imprint of Terror&rsquo;s fat b- I mean large, well armored frame sat down next to the rock, but Smoke thinks the wolf <em>may</em> have laid down there for some time, watching Surt. That is about when the symbol was carved. The carving was done with the toe claw from a paw, not any kind of tool. After that, Smoke&rsquo;s not sure. The wolf got up to leave, but she can&rsquo;t make out any specific direction due to the age of the tracks.</p>
<p>Smoke has her theories, but Terror is free to decide what she thinks all of this means.</p>
<p><strong>Hunger- Filters- </strong>The Hunger&rsquo;s initial inspection reveals nothing out of place. The Hunger, however, is not one to take anything on a simple spot check. While there has been no obvious gratuitous sabotage, at least one of the groups spying on his allies has demonstrated a strong knowledge of alchemy. There is a high chance of such tampering.</p>
<p>Hunger takes randomized samples from every filter, as well as a variety of water samples. He goes over them with a fine tooth comb. Literally, actually. He still has plenty of his original notes and a large amount of original samples of the mixtures used to create the filters originally. He does a series of blind tests, examining the samples for even extremely subtle signs of tampering.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, he finds nothing. None of the samples he takes indicate tampering. He repeats the test a few more time with more random samples, and gets the same results. Finally, he fully examines each individual potential failure point in the purification center both with magic and by hand.</p>
<p>No tampering. In the end, the project takes him nearly as long as researching it did in the first damned place, but he&rsquo;s certain whatever happened the purification process was not tampered with and the water it produces is still exactly what they need.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Lock/Bead- </strong>First of all, the research on Protection from Evil hits an immediate brick wall. Protection from Evil only protects your mind from outside evil influences. The dog is well and truly part of him by this point. It won&rsquo;t do any good.</p>
<p>Research on Arcane Lock and an Anti-Polymorph bead turns out fairly easy. First of all, a custom version of Arcane Lock would be easy enough to make. It actually might be slightly easier to tweak the spell to have a fixed duration. Not too much of a hassle, especially if it&rsquo;s put on an item. Only has to work once per day.</p>
<p>The bead is a bit trickier. Activation is the problem, mostly. It could be tricked to delay a transformation, of course, much like that first transformation. Might give him a chance to reach safety. The dog, of course, has no desire to activate such an item. Maybe it could be worked into a trap of some kind? That, and he still has no idea if he would regain control of himself if the transformation is reversed, or if so for how long.</p>
<p>Then, he runs into a serious problem. He is not an arcane caster, nor magic item crafter. Neither of those base spells are available as extracts. He would have to get help to make these, and it would be <em>mighty</em> suspicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Barrabus- </strong>Ever the snoop and busybody, Barrabus gets to work. He chats up a few government workers to see if they know anything, but quickly gets nowhere. Just more rumors that can&rsquo;t be confirmed. He does, however, gather a few things that are useful, not the least of which is where Hunger&rsquo;s lab is.</p>
<p>Barrabus is able to sweet talk his way into the central government compound enough, but getting into Hunger&rsquo;s office turns out to be quite the challenge. He manages to slip in past a cleaning staff, but can&rsquo;t find the entrance to Hunger&rsquo;s lab. Curious, he manages to snoop around Hunger&rsquo;s desk but finds little useful, other than some odd orders for paralysis flowers.</p>
<p>Hunger enters the room while Barrabus is snooping, but he is able to duck behind Hunger&rsquo;s desk before he&rsquo;s spotted. Hunger does something with a bookcase to enter his lab. Barrabus isn&rsquo;t able to spot it on account of hiding, but notes just how secure Hunger&rsquo;s door is - and just how many locks he secures on the way in. Barrabus notes that he&rsquo;ll make another attempt to snoop in the Hunger&rsquo;s lab some other time. It sounds like a lot of work to get in there.</p>
<p>Fury&rsquo;s research are turns out to be much less secure. Scorch marks on the floor, for some reason. Not that odd, I guess. He fiddles around her office for a bit. He&rsquo;s got some training in spellcraft, enough to recognize rituals. He has a pretty good idea what most are, until he notices a hidden batch of files at the bottom of a drawer in her armoire.</p>
<p>These contain rituals he doesn&rsquo;t recognize. Powerful looking ones. Old looking ones. Jackpot! He digs through these pages and pages of grim looking rituals, but can&rsquo;t put together much other than the fact that they look very dark and very dangerous. While he is snooping, he is interrupted&hellip;</p>
<p>Fury is standing at the door, arms folded, sparking. Staring right at him. With his hands still in her drawer full of drawers.</p>
