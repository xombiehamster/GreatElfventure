<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Event: </strong><strong>Moderate Consequence (Civil Unrest)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duration: </strong>Until the Charred Eagles withdraw and Bravo Division leaves Surt, or other solution is applied</p>
<p><strong>Effect: Praesidium cannot be invoked; +1 setback die to Cloak and Dagger rolls; +1 setback die to Infrastructure actions in Gerdr</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Enrichment): Concrete Curtain [the Smoke]</p>
<p> The Coyotes aren&rsquo;t just a threat to Surt and Gerdr, but to every being (elf or otherwise) moving through Surtian lands. To that end, the Smoke (who&rsquo;s really getting into this whole &lsquo;fortification building&rsquo; thing) sets out to establish permanent defenses for Surt&rsquo;s major roadway, with the intent of expanding them once Surt has more than one road.</p>
<p> Step one is to create minor forts along the road, to serve as a combination of &ldquo;patrol point&rdquo; and &ldquo;gatehouse&rdquo;, where travelers can rest, lookouts can observe the area, and Expansionary Guard units can hold ground against minor raids. These castellum will consist mainly of a concrete watchtower, adjacent to the roadway, flanked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_hedgehog">concrete hedgehogs</a> (thank the clever lads at the CPC for this design; they&rsquo;re comparatively cheap and a pain to move) and surrounded by some of the nastier elements of local vegetation. At key points along the route, where the local terrain makes off-road passage difficult, the castellum will have attached gates that can be sealed to force enemy traffic to circle the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Step two is more ecologically focused. The Smoke intends to encourage some of the Marr&rsquo;s nastier and more exciting plants to grow along the edges of the roadway. These plants -- such as atrocity grass, poison cedar, roper cactus, magmatic cactus, any cactus really, and savage garlic -- should serve to slow down and interfere with external insertion onto the Surtian roadway. To facilitate anyone attempting to work the local area, a few key gatehouses will have &ldquo;dropbridges&rdquo; that can allow controlled access to the Marr in general, while Surt and Gerdr will have regular open pathways.</p>
<p> Step three is a bit more experimental, and involves large devices deployed on the roofs of some watchtowers. The Smoke calls them &lsquo;caltropapults&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p> <em>NOTE FOR GM: The goal of this is to upgrade the aspect All Roads Lead to Surt to apply disadvantage or negative dice to opposing conventional warfare operations targeting Surtian territory.</em></p>

<p><strong>Spending 1 FP to motivate a second Economic Action</strong></p>
<p>Mercantilism (Venture): Wargames [the Terror, Tsun, and Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p> While the Charred Eagles are holding fortifications in and around Riverhaven, the Terror attempts to arrange &ldquo;wargames&rdquo; with the Blade Elf military academy, in order to train some of her soldiers in handling horses and enemy cavalry. She orders some of her lower commanders (particularly those normally handling border patrols and area defense -- the soldiers most likely to see widespread Coyote raiding attempts) to attend, where possible. The Terror will not be able to attend the majority of the wargames, but will at least be able to observe briefly.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Even if the attempt to arrange wargames with the Blade Elves does not succeed, there are a number of advantages to this. For starters, it will give the Terror &ldquo;cover&rdquo; as she organizes the movement of the newly-acquired Cazadore horses over to Surt for eventual training and support of a cavalry unit. Second, it gives the Terror a chance to view this military academy and observe its actions in person.</p>
<p> The &ldquo;third&rdquo; advantage is for Barrabus Leafstorm, who seizes on the news as soon as he&rsquo;s able to snoop it out. The Phoenix Imperialis have been trying to drop the anvil of responsibility on him ever since he got back from Coldwater, so why not jump on this banana peel and try to get the Impies what they want?&nbsp;</p>
<p> Part of the &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; between Barry and the Impy chiefs is less &ldquo;running off and being out of reach&rdquo;, so he&rsquo;s not going to actually attend the wargames (and they&rsquo;ll just have to deal with the result; Barry&rsquo;s happy not to micromanage). What he can do is organize the Fire Elf side of things, maintain lines of communication, and select who actually gets to show up. This is&hellip; a lot of paperwork, but its paperwork safely within the walls of Surt, and with some careful speeches, he should be able to get someone else to do it anyway&hellip;</p>
<p> The fourth advantage is for Tsun. Now with the backing of a full majority of Ashen, and with merchants providing economic support, Tsun can focus on putting her agendas and talking points out into the public discourse. And thanks to her discussion with Embebi at the start of last season, Tsun has some new tactics.</p>
<p> She starts with arguments aimed at the military levies most likely to be recruited to this wargames event -- not so that they won&rsquo;t actually get recruited, but to &ldquo;set the tone&rdquo; of the recruitment. &ldquo;Why are the Blade Elves hosting wargames while our bravest and best fight in the south? Why are their soldiers quartered in Surt, safe behind its walls, while the Charred Eagles die to protect outsiders? Are the Blade Elves so weak that they can&rsquo;t send their own? Are *we* now the champions of Elves in their stead?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Tsun works to set a tonal change to the &lsquo;anti-war&rsquo; argument. In her mind, the war is already inevitable. &ldquo;But look at who has been sent,&rdquo; she argues. &ldquo;The Flying and Dreamdust Elves can&rsquo;t stand on their own. The Blade Elves stand aside. Only the Fire Elves have struck a blow. This isn&rsquo;t a chance to &lsquo;learn&rsquo; from the Blade Elves, but to <em>teach</em> them what real courage looks like.&rdquo; (d)</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=0027b267db133300e7a0a08a48961919">Roll</a>: 1 advantage (lol)</p>
<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery (Leadership): Dueling Speeches [Barrabus Leafstorm and Tsun]</p>
<p> <em>Includes upgrade from Turn 9 Political Action</em></p>
<p> Credit where credit is due; Coyote did have a good point amid his sea of misunderstandings. Barrabus Leafstorm has been getting lazy, and that has to end.</p>
<p> Not in terms of avoiding work, mind. If Barrabus is to maintain his cushy position <em>and</em> his cushy reputation, he needs to be clever. He needs to remind the Imperialis who <em>and</em> what he is.</p>
<p>To that end, his first action upon returning to Surt is to identify the six would-be contenders and <em>congratulate</em> them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine, spot-on deduction!&rdquo; he declares. &ldquo;<em>Of course</em> I played the absent and useless leader. Look at the Ashen! Ashwalker Tsun has been drawn into <em>another</em> untenable position -- one that could easily lead to her expulsion -- and best of all, she has to support our own arguments to do it! And now, with the Ashen clearly opposing the Triumvirate&rsquo;s agenda, our &lsquo;weak and leaderless&rsquo; Imperialis can rise Phoenix-hot into its vacated position. And all the while, Tsun strengthens our position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She talks of the &lsquo;cowardice&rsquo; of the Blade Elves, but it is the <em>courage</em> and <em>decisive action</em> of the Fire Elves that will carry Surt into its future. In my venture southwards to rescue Shadimon of the Flying Elves, I encountered this &lsquo;Coyote&rsquo; head-on, and I can tell you from personal experience that you will find no bandit king more ruthless, and no tyrant more tenacious. The Ashen are correct that the other nations should stand against him -- and they <em>will</em> stand, while we <em>lead.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of lead&hellip; My absence had a second, greater purpose. Gentle-elves, the Imperialis is fractured. Disorganized. Ambiguous. It needs a clear, defined purpose, or the people will never stand behind it, or even view it as anything more than a wealthy gentle-elves club. And as you&rsquo;ve seen for yourselves, my time is limited; I cannot always duel dictators and run recruitment at the same time. I need a second; someone who has the drive, the clarity, and the knowledge to support the Imperialis&rsquo; efforts, while I work to give the people our clear and illustrious vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, I am most impressed with all of you. I returned expecting only one or two would have had the skill and intelligence to recognize my gambit for what it is -- but instead I came back to find <em>six</em> of Surt&rsquo;s greats ready to bring our city to its destiny. But this leaves in question who would be the best choice. Who among you would be the most skilled? The most capable of handling the day to day of administration, while still supporting me as I drive us forward?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the greatest of Surt&rsquo;s greats. Who would you choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the six would-be princes and princesses argued, Phoenix Lord Barrabus Leafstorm sat back, studied them, and casually selected whichever one looked most willing to do paperwork, and least likely to argue with him.</p>
<p>Barry&rsquo;s goal here is not just to get a second in command to do all of the paperwork, but to give the Imperialis some actual organization -- select a second and subsidiary positions, and use those positions to leverage his so-called responsibilities across the whole. He selects a secretary to draft the organization charter and by-laws; a treasurer to unify finances; a plebiast to handle public relations; and a whole host of other lesser positions suggested by his new &lsquo;council of six&rsquo;, informally known as the Chamber of Firebirds. The goal is to create a unified front, to match the Ashen, but with the advantage of not being made up of dozens of different sects (though the dozens of different merchants of the PI aren&rsquo;t that much better).&nbsp;</p>
<p>And more to the point, this new, unified PI can use Ashen talking points to their own benefit. <em>Of course</em> the Charred Eagles are leading the fight -- the Fire Elves are the champions of Elven society, and the only ones still strong enough and courageous enough to pick up a sword and charge in. <em>Of course</em> the Triumvirate made the first aggressive move among the allies -- the Fire Elves have <em>always</em> stood up to bullies and thieves, and will not bend the knee to them now. The Horse wasn&rsquo;t a waste, it was a <em>warning</em> -- &lsquo;you take from us, and you will burn&rsquo; -- and all lost goods are but a trifle compared to what Surt would lose by refusing to stand.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>To her credit, Tsun also has a fair few arguments to throw down, and she is more than willing to do so publicly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asvardi and Riverhaven are failed states,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;First they take our resources, providing nothing tangible in return. Now they require our military, to hold off mere bandits -- bandits that are only a threat to poorly-run, poorly-defended settlements whose leaders are citizens are <em>clearly unwilling</em> to make a stand on their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made no promises at Surt&rsquo;s birth. We did not ask for favors, or loans, or support. As the Triumvirate promised once, we built our nation from our own hands, with our own resources. We carved from the volcanic rock of the Marr a jeweled city, self-sufficient and independent. Why then has the Triumvirate turned its back on our people? Why are our soldiers spending their lives defending those whom we owe nothing? Why are we feeding and housing Blade Elf soldiers to whom we owe nothing? Why engage ourselves in a &lsquo;war&rsquo; against scraggly southern ruffians against whom we owe nothing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Triumvirate were chosen to champion the cause of the Fire Elf people, and they <em>must</em> turn back to that cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Blade Elves lay claim to being the most martial of our disparate peoples, but all they have done since the war ended is cower in fortresses while others do the work. If they wish to claim their martial virtues, let them prove it! Return the Charred Eagles to our city, and send the &lsquo;Guardelves&rsquo; to the front in their place! Let <em>them</em> fight for other elves <em>for once</em>, and admit what we of Surt already know -- the Fire Elves have <em>supplanted</em> them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Both sides are attempting to seize control of the situation -- Tsun to use the civil unrest to take control of political opinion, and force the Triumvirate to bend; Barrabus to quash the unrest with a new political ideal, and a new, unified Phoenix Imperialis political party, able to stand up to the Ashen and sway the citizens&rsquo; views to match their own.</p>

<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Support): Desert Power [the Terror]</p>
<p>The next engagement with the Coyotes is inevitable, and the brief respite here is the best time to prepare for the next assault. Unfortunately, the Coyotes&rsquo; high mobility reduces the utility of hardened defensive positions, which would also have the added penalty of making it more overtly clear that Breaker&rsquo;s Cazadores are sheltering here (both because of the fact that there are defensive positions in place [they&rsquo;re pretty obvious], and because they&rsquo;d have to be designed to allow cavalry to support the defenders).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terror hasn&rsquo;t had tremendous experience with deserts (the Marr is kind of a different beast), but she is aware of the terrain&rsquo;s ability to interfere with sight lines. Large, open areas full of light-reflecting sand and rock tend to disrupt or &lsquo;sunblind&rsquo; most elves. Fire Elves are curiously immune to this effect, but most humanoids -- including Dreamdust and Coyotes -- are not. And making it harder for the Coyotes (Breaker really needs to come up with a new name for her people) to spot the Charred Eagles&rsquo; positions will only help.</p>
<p>To that end, the Terror has the Charred Eagles start work on &lsquo;desert camouflage&rsquo;. Carts and structures are covered in sand, or brown netting that can hold plants. Armor and uniforms are dusted with sand, and traced with black and brown lines to help disrupt soldiers&rsquo; silhouettes (similar to what some of the local fauna has). Scouts and spotters make canvas &lsquo;sandcloaks&rsquo; and decorate their helmets and uniforms with local flora to help mask their positions. These won&rsquo;t help outside of the immediate area, but will definitely for the defense of Riverhaven.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Magic): Soapbubble [the Hunger and the Fury]</p>
<p>Massive magma plume. Underneath Surt. Concerning.</p>
<p>The Hunger wants to arrange a full problem analysis project between the CPC and the Fury&rsquo;s Arcane Circles, but beforehand, its probably a good idea to scan beneath Surt and see if there&rsquo;s any near-term risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=c6f04e21db633300e7a0a08a4896191d">Roll</a>: 3 advantage</p>
<p><strong>Character Actions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fury Action:</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the rumors surrounding the lava lake that has the Fury&hellip; more than a little concerned. She knows the deepscan hasn&rsquo;t revealed any evidence of a lair -- or of any air pockets, for that matter -- but that&rsquo;s not a guarantee that there isn&rsquo;t something living down there, and so far the rumors show no signs of quieting down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fury&rsquo;s expertise on &ldquo;strange things that live in lava&rdquo; is somewhat lacking (<em>Knowledge (Arcana): 10</em>), but she&rsquo;s also aware that she&rsquo;s not the only one who might be interested in finding out what&rsquo;s down there. There was a Flappy researcher -- Anasatri, wasn&rsquo;t it? She might have a few ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ink might, as well.</p>
<p>The Fury hesitates on that thought -- is it rude to ask for help twice, and have provided so little in return -- but then decides to go for it. She fires a flappymail message to Anasatri and Ink, asking them if they&rsquo;re interested in finding out the <em>Mystery of the Lava Lake</em>. If it is a dragon&hellip; maybe there&rsquo;s a chance at communication? Should they just start leaving letters by the lavapools, next to a casserole or something (you give neighbors casseroles right?)?</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action</strong>:</p>
<p>Coyotes hit hard, but still active, and likely plotting revenge. Tsun leading a new civil disobedience campaign. Dog still tucked inside his head. Surt is sitting on top of a massive lavaflow.</p>
<p>The Hunger gets the feeling that he should be angry, or at least frustrated, by all this, but instead... he isn&rsquo;t. As a matter of fact, he&rsquo;s&hellip; surprisingly joyful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it's the vindictive, crude joy of setting an enemy&rsquo;s house on fire. Maybe it's the feeling of power, as a number of good plans (and good fortune) come together with surprising elegance. Maybe it's hubris.</p>
<p>Either way, the Hunger is left far too cheerful this season, and is thus eager to try out new and exciting methods for relieving himself of various long-term ills. First on his list -- a homunculus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He quickly drafts out a schematic of the &lsquo;creature&rsquo;, aiming for it to have the form of a eastern-borne pseudodragon, and gathering into it the potion materials needed to provide it with inherent access to <em>ant haul</em> and <em>adhesive spittle</em>, as well as a voice. The body itself requires alchemical forging; the Hunger gathers the necessary ambules of aqua regia, gold dust, silica, and copper dust, with the intention of electroplating the necessary components together in a solution of aqua regia and the required thaumatic elixirs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Craft (Alchemy): 29</p>
<p><strong>Dogtalk</strong></p>
<p id="HungerLetter">I would be a lot more accepting towards giving you freedom if I knew for certain you were not going to go full canine and rip Tsun&rsquo;s throat out the moment the opportunity presents itself. Trust is expensive; if you want it, earn it. <br />So tonight, we will start with something safe and basic. The door to the office is locked, but you have free reign of the lab for the night, and open season to work on any projects we have on the table. Be advised I will be checking for evidence of tampering or escape attempts aftwards; please do not be insulted, but neither of us can afford to be careless, even in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Ah, very good! Yes, that will work quite nicely. As far as Tsun, finding her corpse with wolf bite marks in the neck would only galvanize her followers. Not my plan.</em></p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>That said, it seems you are willing to be civil. To that I will respond in kind. I won't kill Tsun unless you agree to it, and honestly right now would be terrible timing.</em></p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>For now, I believe I will work on something that keeps us both alive. You acquired those flowers to stun me if I ever escaped, but I believe they could be adapted as a weapon. If the Tourist really does hunt afflicted like Staurois says, then we have little choice but to assume if she sees us again she will realize that her bite afflicted you. She will doubtlessly try to kill us immediately, and a single fire bomb is unlikely to stop her. I have an idea&hellip;</em></p>
<p>In the morning Hunger finds a prototype weapon on the table. It is a sealed ball about the size of a bomb designed to violently pop open if thrown at a target, dosing everyone in a five foot radius with the paralyzing poison of the blue lily. It only works with that poison, but only consumes one dose.</p>
<p>The Dog also started cultivating more blue lilies, but that seems to be a project it can't get done in one night.</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>The next morning, the Hunger tucked the prototype into a pouch on his chiton, and quickly went to work making copies of the basic design (for records and storage), as well as assisting the Dog&rsquo;s plans to expand Blue Lily production.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="HungerLetter">An excellent idea -- but one reliant on defeating the subject&rsquo;s physical resistances. And unfortunately, that is one area where Lycans are <em>infamously</em> recalcitrant. To guarantee this works, we either need to up the strength of the dosage, or add in additional, non-physical attack vectors. <br />Since last month&rsquo;s experiment appeared to work, let&rsquo;s repeat the procedure. We have plenty of work to do on the homunculus project, after all. Alternatively, we can work on the lilies a bit further.<br />On the subject of Tsun -- honestly, the main reason I am reticent about killing her is Leafstorm. Look at what is happening with the Ashen around for the Imperials to rally against -- an entire new political faction has risen from its &ldquo;practically nothing&rdquo; existence, and has somehow forced <em>Leafstorm</em> to rally citizens against her. <br />Actual political debate. Competition. Investment in the state. This is what Surt needs -- citizens who <em>believe</em> in an identity. <em>And</em> its a political system that stays out of our way&hellip; for the most part. I suspect we&rsquo;ll need to keep them running against each other to keep it that way.</p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Yes, I have been paying attention to that. Tsun's still a wildcard. I believe we at least need a plan to deal with her should the situation change. A plausible accident, a suitable successor&hellip; it could be done. I am far more in favor of Leafstorm's nascent party. They seem far more open to the pathways that would bring Surt to greatness.</em></p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Besides, list all the truly grand cultures that changed history and defined the world, but were paranoid isolationists. I'll wait.</em></p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>I am going to keep working on the lillies project for the moment. Mundane as it is, it could save our hide.</em></p>
<p>Progress is made, and the Dog appears to have planted a few more seeds as well as drafted some plans for strengthening the effects.</p>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<h3>Fall Year 3 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Results-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic- Roads-</strong> While the more extreme ideas don't really pan out (Caltropapults? Seriously?), the basic idea of fortifying the main road into Surt is a success. That road and other future roads into Surt will be upgraded to <em>Fortified Roadways</em>. This currently only counts for territories adjacent to Surt itself.</p>
<p>These fortifications will provide an automatic setback die to any enemy attempts to attack Surtian Infrastructure in these territories or to besiege Surt itself, and can be Invoked in defensive operations of Surt.</p>
<p><strong>Military Exercises-</strong> The war games are not as rousing a success as hoped, but they are still generally a net gain. One of the biggest problems is numbers- other than the blade elves, no one is able to devote a full division to this. Instead of war games, it turns into more of a series of demonstrations and small scale exercises.</p>
<p>Still, this is far from a total loss. While you aren't able to come up with any new grand strategies or troop deployments, the demonstrations are good for morale and Breaker and a few of her Cazadores are able to demonstrate what they're capable of. Litoria and a few of the Crocodilians who aren't still recovering from their losses demonstrate some of their river ambush tactics. Dark elves demonstrate some of their close quarters fighting in the fort. Dreamdust elves give primers on night fighting and desert tactics. The fire elves are able to demonstrate shield walls and a phalanx. Shadimon isn't able to fly, but Shrike is able to demonstrate the aerial tactics they have developed with the blade elves. The blade elves show off the offensive and defensive capabilities of the swordelves. Even the mighty and terrifying Echo, made even more terrifying by horrible burn scars now covering nearly half his body, shows up with a few of his Euclast warriors and show off their brutal front line slugging potential.</p>
<p>All in all while it is not exactly what Terror had hoped, it's a success. The morale boost will provide all who participated with a boost die on the Drill trapping of Military Science next season.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Surtian politics are tumultuous and dramatic, and this season is no exception. Barrabus proves to be one of the few elves that can counter Tsun's fiery invective head on. His wit and oratory skills are quite up to par, and with some kind of purpose finally behind him he is able to engage Tsun in public debate, taking the fight to what was previously her strongest field. These debates prove to be fiery crowd pleasers, with large groups of both Imperialis and Ashen supporters attending.</p>
<p>It is during one of these public debates that a shocking turn of events occurs. During the debate, in front of dozens of witnesses, a Coyote assassin lunges out of the crowd and attempts to kill Barrabus. Surprisingly, Tsun leaps into action and assists Barrabus in fighting the assassin. The two are able to fight off the interloper, but he flees into the crowd and manages to escape.</p>
<p>After the assassination attempt, Tsun is not seen for several days. Her supporters claim she was struck by a poisoned dagger meant for Barrabus, but he doesn't remember seeing her take such a hit. Regardless, Barrabus presses his advantage. He turns the situation on its head, claiming that by protesting instead of doing their jobs, the Praesidium are weakening Surt. He claims that the fire elves are already deeply involved in this conflict, and splitting hairs about cooperation with allies is pointlessly contrarian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is during this brief period that something quite surprising happens. A large group of winged elves arrive carrying a shipment of copper from their mines. The winged elves, completely ignorant of Surtian politics, deliver this shipment directly and publicly to the Triumvirate as a gift in thanks for the sacrifices Surt has made to protect Asavardi and fight the Coyotes. This delivery actually happens <em>during </em>and Imperialis rally lead by Barrabus by <em>pure coincidence.</em></p>
<p>The winged elves are predictably mobbed by merchants and traders looking to gain access to copper. The Triumvirate distributes the copper to merchants according to who sacrificed the most to make the Horse happen.</p>
<p>Conveniently, this makes a few of the most vocal critics fall silent. It's hard to argue that the winged elves "offered nothing in return" anymore. Further, several merchants hash out trade agreements for the much desired copper.</p>
<p>In the end, economics win out. The protests dwindle and some of the loudest critics fall silent. Tsun is put on her back foot, and forced to agree that the safety of the city comes first.</p>
<p><em>Civil Unrest</em> is no longer ongoing and you are no longer suffering its penalties. Tsun still manages to make it a net gain however, retaining at least a few merchants in her political bloc for financial support. In addition, her heroic actions in helping to protect Barrabus reinforces public opinion that she wants to protect all fire elves, not just the ones she agrees with.</p>
<p>The Imperialis however come out well forward. With the surprise boon of the copper shipment and Barrabus' leadership, they are now a force to be reckoned with in Surtian politics.</p>
<p><br />You now have a <em>Copper Shipment </em>Aspect to use as you wish. In addition, due to connections made with winged elf trades to the Imperialis, all further Trade checks made with the Winged Elves will have the difficulty decreased by one.</p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> You have successfully applied the <em>Concealed Positions </em>Aspect to your forces defending Riverhaven. This aspect can be invoked in the event of an attack on Riverhaven, and on a successful defense that becomes a unit scale battle you will have a surprise round and more flexibility in placing your units.</p>
<p>While concealing their position in a desert is not something the Charred Eagles are familiar with, it is a specialty of one of the locals. You are not the only force who came to aid Riverhaven. An organized group of about 200 Machakw warriors have also taken up defensive positions around riverhaven, and are concealing their positions in the same way. While at first they seem reluctant to interact with your forces, when they see what you are doing a few translators come over to coordinate with you and provide pointers.</p>
<p>Currently, the defenses at Riverhaven are looking reasonable. Between the Dreamdust, Fire elf, and Machakw forces you have about 800 troops. There are also about 150 Cazadores, but it is unclear how many of them are in fighting shape with their recent heavy losses. The traps and concealed fighting positions will help negate some of the open field advantage attackers would have, but cavalry could still be a serious problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally the dreamdust elves seem willing to give you the horses they were delivered. Katiin is eager, but doesn't have the recruits or resources on hand to rebuild her cavalry at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>Blast it all, ritual magic is just plain <em>hard</em>. The Fury, for all her talent, is learning more about it. In her life before, it had seemed something rare and dangerous. And you know what? It <em>is</em>. Extremely dangerous. No matter how mundane or routine, the sheer amount of raw arcane energy involved in a ritual is hazardous in and of itself. No matter how good you are or how prepared you feel, there&rsquo;s always a chance that something goes hinky and everything goes bonkers.</p>
<p>The trick, Fury is finding, is making sure the fallout is managed. <em>Something</em> is under Surt, that&rsquo;s for sure. The level of feedback Fury gets from the deep scan ritual is immense. However, her several seasons spent preparing the ritual circles in Surt, training her staff, and researching pays off. No one is injured by the immense amount of magic feedback, and Fury is able to channel it into a rather dazzling display of lights and fireworks that goes off over the palace for a day or two.. She gives her staff a well-deserved break after narrowly avoiding disaster.</p>
<p>While this turn was rough, that&rsquo;s just the dice with ritual magic. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any increased risk in trying again, or anything about the terrain under Surt that makes this ritual more dangerous than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Barrabus-</strong> Barrabus has managed to keep it together. Thanks to judicious delegation (a skill he has some talent for) he is able to retain his position as Phoenix Lord. He proves himself far more than just an empty headed decoration, and his personal drive gives unity of vision to the Imperialis. He will have to devote a not insignificant amount of his time to leading the Imperialis, but it will mostly be high level decision making and delivering guidance on major policies. This, of course, makes Barrabus ask hard questions about what he really <em>do</em>es value and how the Imperialis can reflect that&hellip;</p>
<p>Regardless, by delegating most of the day to day operations of the Imperialis to the Council of Six, he gives himself enough leeway to go on the occasional adventure without leaving the Imperialis rudderless. Too much time absent will still cause a problem, but so long as he's actually accomplishing something and not just wandering off it should be manageable.</p>
<p>Also, gifts! The winged elf messengers deliver a package, along with a message from Shadimon. He gives his thanks for Barrabus' role in the rescue, along with a couple magic trinkets to remember it by.</p>
<p>First off a pair of stylish and comfortable leather boots that are enchanted as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/a-b/daredevil-softpaws/">daredevil softpaws.</a> Also included is a copper hat-pin in the shape of a violin. It is enchanted like an everburning torch that can be turned on and off at will. In addition, he receives one of Shadimon's feathers as a personal thanks. Nifty!</p>

<p><strong>Hunger- </strong>Despite <em>constant daily messages from the First on feathernet asking the most inane and baffling of questions</em>, Hunger manages to complete his Homunculus. The extra set of hands around the lab proves helpful, especially now that he has to manage spam calls.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the dog's reply to the first message is oddly positive. We'll get to that in a bit, but perhaps a third set of hands is indeed helpful...</p>
