<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves ain&rsquo;t got no problems&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3 id="jump">Roleplay Event 2.1.1: <a href="../Bonus/3_A Hitchhiker in Partager.php">A Hitchhiker in Partager</a></h3>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Establishment): The Backbone of Nations [the Hunger]</p>
<p><em>Includes a Bonus Die from Locke&rsquo;s Extra Supplies (Year 0)</em></p>
<p><em>Includes an Upgrade from Academics (Spring Year 1)</em></p>
<p><em>Includes an Upgrade from Lumber Shipment Aspect (Spring Year 1)</em></p>
<p>Expanding Surt into a proper township is a vital step in the growth of the Fire Elves as a people, and the Hunger has been planning for this eventual upgrade for the entirety of this past year, even as he designed the aqueduct and struggled with agricultural initiatives. The plan is extensive, and involves serious upgrades to the city&rsquo;s primary thoroughfares, the expansion of several rooftops to provide some park-like gardens, and a formal rewrite of the city charter and many of the laws. Perhaps ironically, most of Locke&rsquo;s supplies are devoted to the roadways, prompting a few comments about &ldquo;good intentions&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spycraft (Cloak and Dagger): Boogeymen [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>With her actions at the &ldquo;Potluck&rdquo; this past Spring thwarted by Anasatri&rsquo;s skilled healing and the Hunger&rsquo;s oratory skills, Tsun switches tactics. Embebi, her newfound (and extremely questionable) ally, argued for a more direct approach to the problem of the Triumvirate&rsquo;s leadership. Step one is to cement the Praesidium as the most important guard system within Surt. And to start with, that means taking direct responsibility for guarding against hostile incursion -- especially if that also helps keep the civilian populace concerned about werewolves lurking behind every corner. Blade Elves are once again on the &ldquo;high priority&rdquo; watchlist -- but this time less because the Hunger is being paranoid, and more because the Ashwalker wants everyone paranoid about Blade Elves. But that&rsquo;s only step one. Step two is...</p>

<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Drill): Coup de Ville [The Terror]</p>
<p>...put on hold until the heat dies down a bit, as a near-confrontation with the Terror makes it very clear exactly how the Triumvirate with react to further &ldquo;aggressive diplomacy&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a close-run thing, with both sides scrambling their closest supporters to place ethical and legal obstacles into each other&rsquo;s path, but in the end the presence of the Terror herself and the full weight of the Triumvirate are more than enough to squash certain ambitions for the time being. Its not a coupe attempt -- the Ashen are popular, but far too fractured (and/or loyal to the Triumvirate) to really support that -- and technically nothing illegal has happened (as a war scholar challenge isn&rsquo;t really covered by Surt&rsquo;s laws), but the Triumvirate decides to &lsquo;diffuse&rsquo; the strength of the Ashen and reorganize some of its influential members into new positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And unfortunately for the Phoenix Imperialis, their primary diplomat is too <em>on vacation</em> to take advantage of this opportunity. He may experience some words when he returns.</p>
<p>Part of this diffusion involves the formation of another new military unit -- a small unit of milites, based on the pre-war Mispelham militia [level 3 warriors]. This unit is more to reinforce the Charred Eagles division rather than to provide a major frontal force, but the pay is better and the job less philosophically demanding than the Ashkin archer units, and it is assumed that many citizens will flock to the opportunity for a comparatively cushy military job. Either way, this will unfocus the Ashwalker&rsquo;s strongest supporters.</p>

<p><strong>Military Action 2 (Motivating with 1 FP):</strong></p>
<p>Reconnaissance (Rangers): Wolfhounds [Ashwalker Tsun]</p>
<p>The Triumvirate determines that a &ldquo;military leader with specialization in stealth&rdquo; should lead the effort to locate the &ldquo;mysterious lupine travelers&rdquo; moving through the general area. And with the Terror needed to lead Surt&rsquo;s defense, and the Ashen so keen to track down any Lycan threat&hellip; the choice is obvious. Tsun and her followers are ordered to assist Surt&rsquo;s best scouts in tracking down whatever party or parties are riding wolves through the nearby area and/or leaving dead humans on Surt&rsquo;s doorstep. There&rsquo;s a strongly implied &ldquo;don&rsquo;t come back until you find something&rdquo; message involved here. Target zones are the squares immediately to the south of Surt.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=6c1763e2dbf93300e7a0a08a48961907">Roll</a>: 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Magic: Detect Ores): Magnetic Attraction [the Fury]</p>
<p>Having successfully recovered from a season-long migraine, and with interstate trade ramping up in the surrounding region, the Fury decides to put the new <em>Detect Ores</em> ritual to the test, aiming for [the four-square block just to the west of those two explored zones immediately west-adjacent to Surt]. It should serve as a viable mining zone should the ritual uncover anything interesting. This experiment also serves as a good stress-test for the city&rsquo;s ritual casters.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=d317b52edbb53300e7a0a08a4896198a">Roll</a>: 1 advantage, 3 successes</p>
<p><strong>Fury Action:</strong></p>
<p>Fury uses RESEARCH to prep for <em>Akashic Communion</em></p>
<p>Every free moment the Fury has is devoted to digging through what few notes exist on the events surrounding the Conflagration -- the signs and portents, the passage of ley lines, the arcanic crafting activity, the supply systems, even the troop movements in the surrounding regions. All in the hopes that any of it may help make sense of what&rsquo;s coming. A chance to use <em>Akashic Communion</em> is a rare opportunity, and she hadn&rsquo;t expected to access spells even close to as powerful for months or years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all at the cost of sharing this insight with a relative unknown&hellip; and risking the oath she made in Mispelham by doing so. But she can&rsquo;t not take this chance. She may never get another.</p>
<p>The tattoo is too beautiful to forget. She tries repeatedly to copy its design (physically and arcanicly -- but only the design, not the magic in it), to at least save it so she can remember it, but no copy ever quite matches up to the original.</p>
<p>She pours as much of the summer as she can into her research, and sets her sights on the last full moon before fall -- as close to the conditions of the Conflagration as possible. She clears some space in her chambers, borrows a square of precious silver from the treasury, lights a few candles, and as the full moon reaches its crest, releases the spell.</p>
<h3 id="back">Roleplay Event 2.1.1: <a href="../Bonus/4_A Painful Memory.php">A Painful Memory</a></h3>
<p><strong>Hunger Action:</strong></p>
<p>Potluck survived, will-improving drugs available. The Hunger decides its time to up his game.</p>
<p>Step one is to put out a call for nonlethal poisons (&lsquo;Drow poison&rsquo; or its equivalent being his primary target, with Azure Lily seeds being a secondary target; the Hunger thinks he might be able to grow Azure Lilies himself with a bit of experimentation). The Dreamdust elves are likely to have access to this, so the Hunger quietly commissions a local merchant to arrange a small amount of trade in these via the River Elves, on the grounds of using them as medical supplies. While not a surefire effect, poisons can be a good way to neutralize the dog&rsquo;s capabilities if taken shortly before the transformation. This is also by no means a permanent solution (frigging divine curses), but he doesn&rsquo;t expect one as of yet. This just buys more time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step two is an alchemy project. What is it about wolfsbane that actually neutralizes the curse in its early stages? Is it possible to disrupt the curse later with concentrated, magically enhanced wolfsbane -- clearly you can&rsquo;t remove it, but maybe enhanced wolfsbane can be used to effectively cripple the dog during transformation. Or at least prevent the dog from being infectious. [Craft Alchemy: 25]</p>
<p>Step three is a surreptitious check to find out if there *are* any powerful divine casters in the area. The Hunger strongly doubts it, but researching tales and legends about local divine powers won&rsquo;t hurt. [Diplomacy (Gather Info): 32]</p>
<p>Step four is to briefly consider trying to become a lich. The Hunger decides that&rsquo;s a little gross, and also that he&rsquo;s not 100% sure that the curse won&rsquo;t find a way to turn him into some kind of lichanthrope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step five is to consider that he may be taking this from the wrong angle. He gets several pieces of chalk, dyes them with a few extra inks, and scrawls &ldquo;write messages here&rdquo; on one of the cell&rsquo;s walls, before leaving a piece of chalk in the cell, next to a pile of goat bones. He considers this extremely unlikely to get anywhere, but worth an experiment.</p>
<h3 id="jump2">Roleplay Event 2.1.2: <a href="../Bonus/6_A Special Delivery.php">A Special Delivery</a></h3>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<h3>Summer Year 2 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Results-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Misc- </strong>Unexpectedly during the improvements to Surt, several boats arrive from Fort Alfyr. On board, there are dozens of fire elf civilians. When the rear lines were overrun during the Battle of Skaplyndi, many of your rear line personnel and camp followers were forced to flee. They had been in hiding out until they knew the war was over. They recently contacted Lock, who gave them supplies and told them to go east until they hit elf.</p>
<p>They also tell you that there are more coming.</p>
<p>Surt will now be receiving semi-regular groups of immigrants, allowing you to establish new settlements and grow old ones according to the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>Surt is ascendant.</p>
<p>Everything that the Hunger had struggled for, everything that the Civil Planning Committee had worked late countless nights for, everything failure and setback comes together. Surt is finally becoming a truly impressive location, a ruby in a fire. You have truly clawed a place to live out of a deadly wasteland, and Surt is becoming beautiful. As the city grows and expands and larger buildings are made, the fire elves begin to show off their artistic side with colorful decorations, alchemically dyed fires, art, and sound. Even moreso, the Aqua Via and Hunger&rsquo;s rooftop gardens spread throughout the city. Even fire elves don&rsquo;t like breathing sulphur, and the plant life filters the air and cools houses.</p>
<p>From vineyards to victory gardens, public parks and botanical gardens, nearly every building of note in Surt now has a garden on top of it fuelled by the aqueducts that crisscross the town. For the rich, they are a place of comfort and a display of wealth. For the poor, they are a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Hunger looks at this, and knows that if Surt survives it is thanks to him.</p>
<p>Thanks to your Triumph, the <em>Rooftop Gardens</em> Aspect has been improved to the <em>Verdant Rooftop Gardens</em> aspect. This aspect may be used once a year to give a bonus die on a check relating to food or plant life. This does not cost a fate point.</p>
<p>You are of course now extremely low on building supplies. With the influx of refugees, Surt grew more than anticipated. It was all handled of course, but significant supply stores were burned. They will be replenished, but your Economic action next turn will take a setback die.</p>
<p>Surt is now Town sized. Its max aspects goes up to 3, and max garrison to 2 divisions. It will be eligible to upgrade to City size on Turn 1, Year 4.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>The Praesidium has its hands full with the batch of the new arrivals. Fearing interlopers will embed themselves with newcomers, Praesidium patrols focus much of their attention on new citizens. They monitor newcomers closely, and even ah, <em>interview</em> many who seem suspicious.</p>
<p>While this makes some newcomers resent the Praesidium, overall many of their supporters feel they do a necessary job.</p>
<p>Don't find any spies though.</p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> <strong>Drill- </strong>Terror has no problems whatsoever recruiting a militia unit. In some ways, it goes better than expected. Of course, on the surface, a Milites unit is created and that&rsquo;s the end of the matter.</p>
<p>In depth, the politics get a bit complicated. Many of the Ashwalker&rsquo;s followers stubbornly resist being recruited away from the Praesidium. Many are of course, but some are digging their heels. The good news is that this new batch of immigrants thrown into the political jumble seems to be mostly landing pro-triumvirate. Most of this Milites unit is newcomers, and it makes a big impression on the new immigrants as it allows many of them to put food on the table for their families and greatly improve their situation from the last few incredibly harsh years.</p>
<p>While a few of the Ashwalker&rsquo;s staunchest supporters are moved, most aren&rsquo;t. Despite this, the Terror is able to sway the newcomers mostly into viewing the Ashwalkers are a small group of fanatics rather than a major political force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A win for sure, but maybe not the one they were hoping for.</p>
<p><strong>Rangers- </strong>Tsun returns having found no wolves, but not empty handed.</p>
<p>Tsun began by carefully examining the assaulted camp. Despite the complication of several groups having stomped around the area since the attack, the rangers are able to get a better picture of what happened.</p>
<p>What happened obviously was a shitload of violence. Quite an important piece of information, the camp was attacked by <em>one person.</em> Whoever attacked the camp had been hiding their tracks well, but appears to have come from the south. They then appear to have simply walked into the camp and killed the crap out of everyone there. It&rsquo;s difficult to piece together exactly what happened, but it appears to have been close combat.</p>
<p>When it was over, they simply walked out - heading northwest, towards Surt. Before you ask, yes the timeline adds up. It had to have been her.</p>
<p>Tsun also finds the camp that the river elves did, but unfortunately they were much better at hiding their tracks. She&rsquo;s not able to find any information that the river elves didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Worse, when scouting the far western square there&rsquo;s an accident. While Tsun and two scouts are on a leg of the scouting mission, a large fumarole cracks open and impracts the group with a spray of toxic gas and glasslike rock fragments. Due to her reflexes Tsun survives with moderately bad gashes from the rocks, but the two scouts with her are overwhelmed by the gases and killed.</p>
<p>With that blemish on a successful but not dramatically so outing, Tsun returns in a foul mood. Due to managing her attitude and the loss of two experienced scouts, Rangers take a setback next turn if they are used.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- </strong>Metal detecting spell detects metal! The top left square of the scanned area has a significant amount of some variety of metal. Of course, this spell doesn&rsquo;t give specifics, but it should be exploitable whatever it is. This square is now marked with a green circle on your map.</p>
<p>The stress test, well, goes slightly less well. Thankfully this was a detection spell and not something high risk. As it turns out, there is an unstable ley line beneath Surt. This was nearly undetectable before a ritual was actually performed, but nearly destroyed the ritual as Fury was casting.</p>
<p>Thankfully she was able to keep it together and get the ritual off safely without any damage to her staff or property. The good news is that this instability can be accounted for and dealt with safely. The bad news is it will require the Fury to reorganize the entire ritual chamber system she had been setting up since turn one. This ritual went of safely, but a higher risk one could be catastrophic.</p>
<p>Any Magic related actions next turn will have a challenge die added, as the Fury is having to rip up all her ritual circles and rebuild them entirely.</p>
<p><em>Bother.</em> At least she doesn&rsquo;t have a migraine this time.</p>
<p><strong>The Hunger&rsquo;s Secret-</strong></p>
<p>Step One- Hunger has successfully received a shipment of dreamdust knockout poison, as well as Azure Lily seeds.</p>
<p>Step Two- It becomes painfully apparent that the Hunger&rsquo;s research is starting to lead him into the territory of religion, faith, and mysticism rather than the realm of rationality and reason. From an alchemical standpoint, there is flatly no evidence of Wolfsbane having any effect other than that of a natural poison after the first transformation. Hunger is able to find a Lycan philosopher&rsquo;s comments on the matter, though:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Luna&rsquo;s gift is the natural hybridization of the soul of a wild animal and a rational one. The affliction is as a tumor, an unnatural beast growing out of the darkest depths of an unfortunate soul, a foul corruption of the soul of the Lycan who transmitted it. Wolfsbane interrupts the manifestation of this tumor and may even detach it from the soul if it is used before it is truly set. Once a transformation has occurred however, the tumor has metastasized in the cursed soul and is a part of the very self of the afflicted.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Shit, that&rsquo;s <em>really</em> not encouraging.</p>
<p>Step Three- The only known remaining cleric who the Hunger is able to confirm is able to cure the affliction is one Sian Llewyn, current High Priestess of Alamada. Unfortunately, High Priestess Llewyn is literally on the other side of the continent and also thoroughly despises elves. She is unlikely to help. The current Dwarven High Cleric of Urist, Droan Brasschest, may be powerful enough but he also hasn&rsquo;t left Crownshead in fifty years. Not likely either.</p>
<p>Step Four- That&rsquo;s a shit idea and you know it.</p>
<p>Step Five- The Hunger is beginning to suspect that there is more to the dog than base instinct. With his preparations, he is able to remember what happened during a transformation a little less than half the time.</p>
<p>Instead of simply pacing the cell and chewing on bone, he remembers examining his bonds, fiddling with the locking mechanism of the door, and inspecting the vents and the walls. Thankfully it does not appear to have his memories of these things.</p>
<p>On the off chance that it may be more than it appears, he leaves the chalk and the message. That morning, he finds a reply scrawled in large letters clearly made while pressing too hard:</p>
<p id="DogLetter">"Set me free you <em>COWARD</em>"</p>
<p>Yeah that's not good.</p>
