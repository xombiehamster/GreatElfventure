<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Fire Elves ain&rsquo;t got no problems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Enrichment): Refined Tastes [the Hunger and Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p>The Hunger has a problem.</p>
<p>While the current economic capacity provided by the new Surtian mint holds solid promise, it isn&rsquo;t really the game-changer he was hoping it would be. That *might* be because certain blond elves seized it while the Hunger was distracted, preventing him from enacting his grander plans, and used the money it provided exclusively to stock their own coffers. And by certain blond elves, the Hunger means Barrabus. Time for a little revenge.</p>
<p>The Hunger&rsquo;s initial plans involved alchemical enhancement of the coinage, thanks to local Surtian components, such as sulfur, and anything else that can be gathered from the Burning Marr. To enact this, a steady supply of material must be secured from the Marr itself. The Hunger decides this is a <em>great</em> job for Barrabus, who <em>doubtlessly will be interested in securing his Imperial&rsquo;s interests in this</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barrabus&hellip; isn&rsquo;t thrilled.</p>
<p>The second step will be to make the alchemical changes to the coinage. The Hunger&rsquo;s goal is to get the coinage (or at least some of it -- special edition coins, maybe?) to the point where it can be used as a replacement for some material components in magic item manufacturing and ritual casting. Should that prove impossible, it should at least be possible to secure enough alchemical ingredients to help with other infrastructure projects that are coming up.</p>

<p><strong>Economic Action 2 (Trade Only, provided by River Elves):</strong></p>
<p>Trade (Merchants): Yellow Brick Road [the Hunger and Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p>The River Elf arrival couldn&rsquo;t have happened at a more perfect time. Surt is going to need bronze, and lots of it, and soon. And to get bronze, Surt needs copper. And what it has in exchange is gold.</p>
<p>In bricks, blocks, chips, and coins, the Hunger coordinates with the incoming River Elf suppliers to exchange quantities of shiny orange metal for quantities of shiny red-and-yellow metal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barrabus Leafstorm insists on being involved, and in fact pressures the Hunger into using local merchants for the majority of exchanges rather than acting as the Triumvirate to trade directly with the River Elves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hunger doesn&rsquo;t find this exactly comfortable, but coordination with Barrabus and the Imperials has a major advantage -- an improved ability to make use of Gerdr&rsquo;s sheltered cove. Thanks to organized efforts by the Imperial&rsquo;s various shipping &ldquo;fleets&rdquo; (a scattering of boats) and the Imperialis supporters within Gerdr, the Hunger hopes to improve the speed of goods exchange, and eliminate any transport costs the River Elves would normally charged for moving the goods all the way to Surt. As part of this, the Hunger also promises to improve the cove&rsquo;s docks and warehousing by the time the flotilla next returns.</p>
<p>In effect, Gerdr&rsquo;s aspect <strong>Fortified Cove</strong> is invoked using its free invoke, to upgrade one die within this Trade.</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery (Leadership): Promotions [the Terror]</p>
<p>Terror concludes that word on the street is&hellip; essentially correct. Doukas is deserving of a promotion. He has served loyally for quite some time, and is effectively in charge of the city&rsquo;s primary police force, reserve defensive force, only counter to the Civile Praesidium&hellip; and primary bastion of formerly pro-Loyalist Muspelhamsters of any note within Surt. He, and they, deserve some recognition.</p>
<p>So while Terror does recognize Captain Doukas and promote him to Legate-Captain Doukas (a modification to the old Legate Augustus rank, about the equivalent of general, but without the proscribed &lsquo;one or two legions only&rsquo; rules of the Lycan Empire), she also formerly guarantees him a villa that befits a high-ranking member of the government, promotes his immediate subordinates accordingly, and moves to improve the buildings and infrastructure the Constabulary Guard operate out of. Some of these are attached to the front gates, as part of providing the Guard with formal control of the gatehouses of Surt; others are in the form of &ldquo;watchouses&rdquo; scattered in Surt&rsquo;s neighborhoods, which can be expanded as the settlement itself expands.</p>
<p>The Terror believes that, while this might be a bit expensive (and uses up a bunch of official state property), it will be good for the city&rsquo;s stability, and the overall success of the Constabulary Guard.</p>
<p>Also, she hasn&rsquo;t gotten to play with infrastructure very often. Seems like its fun.</p>
<p><em>Goal: promote Doukas, transfer Morale damage to Property</em></p>

<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Reconnaissance (Rangers): Scooby Do Where Are You? [the Smoke]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate sand. Its coarse, and grainy, and gets everywhere -- and Cal&rsquo;s Grace its in my pants aughowohgodtheitching!&rdquo; -- the Smoke</p>
<p>Okay, so, no sign of Wolf Elves on the last run, but&hellip; that was kind of in the middle of a sandstorm, and the Smoke is very confident that even Wolf Elves will balk at traveling during long and uncomfortable sandstorms. So time for a do-over.</p>
<p>The Smoke sets out with her best scouting team, aiming for the exact same spot along the river as last time.. Maybe with sandstorm season over, they might actually catch something.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=8f5f114edb110010e7a0a08a48961904">Roll</a>: 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): Pepper Spraybottle [the Fury]</p>
<p>Okay, good job, Fury. You've got a good ritual here. The trick now is to not get greedy. Push the limits, find ways to improve it, but don't push too hard. Don't get greedy.</p>
<p>...In fact, why not take advantage of Wolf Elf "strengths"? They're supposed to be like Lycans, right? Why not hit them right where they think they're strongest? Take advantage of their biology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ink says you're direct, huh? What's more direct than a punch to the nose?</p>
<p><em>(Goal: upgrade ritual to inflict challenge dice (starting at 1), and at character level, affected targets with scent must make a caster level check when attempting to cast (as per the Disruptive Spell meta magic feat) -- this is to help justify the upgrade to challenge dice. This can be at the high DC for as long as the Stinking Cloud lasts, or at DC 8 for as long as the smell effect lasts, depending entirely on which you think is more appropriate )</em></p>

<p><strong>Mental Action 2 (motivated by 1 refresh):</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Creation): Country Planning Committee [the Hunger]</p>
<p>The CPC has been an essential part of Surt-the-nation&rsquo;s growth over the past four years, but if it is to meet the needs of its growing populace, it has to expand with them. As such, the Hunger gets with the CPC and various Imperialis and Praesidium representatives, and sets about making plans for how to expand their governance and capacity (and the Imperialis&rsquo; and Praesidium&rsquo;s powers and capacity, for that matter) as Surt-the-city and Surt-the-nation expand and begin to cover more territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of primary concern is Surt-the-city&rsquo;s expansion. The Hunger is blunt; Surt&rsquo;s population is increasing, and is likely to get too large for its current infrastructure within the next year. Plans are already in motion to help get the &ldquo;town&rdquo; to true City size within the next year, without having to rely on tent cities or &ldquo;instant slums&rdquo; within the interim. With some finesse, it might even be possible to grow Surt to a point where it can safely remain below capacity for a decade or longer.</p>
<p><em>Goal: provide a bonus to an upcoming &ldquo;grow Surt to city size&rdquo; check within the next year</em></p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=278621c2db510010e7a0a08a48961995">Roll</a>: 4 successes</p>
<p><strong>Character Actions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action: </strong>Government Dialogue</p>
<p><em>To Shadimon:</em></p>
<p><em>When my fellows in the Triumvirate and I initially sat down to write a response to your request, we intended to provide you with a solid and consistent course of action that would lead your people into a permanently stable form of government that would remain just, functional, and adaptable forever, regardless of circumstances and the needs of your people.</em></p>
<p><em>As my comrade the Fury was quick to point out, however, such a government doesn&rsquo;t exist. And nor are we experts. To be honest, Shadimon, even among the three of us, we have a grand total of twelve years experience as Heads of State. A non-insignificant amount, but hardly what I&rsquo;d call expert levels of practice.</em></p>
<p><em>Instead, what we can provide for you is practical recommendations. Systems that we have records of having worked previously, or have worked for us in the past. Logical solutions that can help you handle complex problems. Strategic pointers that will assist with the grand strategy of your nation (and yes, your nation should have a grand strategy -- even if it is just &ldquo;continue existing&rdquo;.)</em></p>
<p><em>At Terror&rsquo;s suggestion, we will start with the concept of Grand Strategy. In general, your nation&rsquo;s Grand Strategy is the motto and values that your culture is based on (even if its just &ldquo;based on right now&rdquo;) combined with the goals you and your people feel drive you forward. As mentioned, that&rsquo;s sometimes just &ldquo;try to survive&rdquo;. In the case of the Lycan Empire, I personally think it was &ldquo;to run free across the land, beholden to no one.&rdquo; As you can guess, this serves as both an example of how Grand Strategies can change over time, as well as how they can lead a nation to ruin.</em></p>
<p><em>Never tell anyone your nation&rsquo;s Grand Strategy. It can and will be used against you.</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m certain you are aware of this already, as your nation is hardly directionless. However, your concept of Grand Strategy is very important for interpreting the type of central government that best fits your people and whom they want to be.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the most ancient and traditional forms of government is &ldquo;direct democracy&rdquo;. This is where &ldquo;the people&rdquo; determine all of the laws by majority vote. There are all kinds of different ways of managing this, from complicated voting methods (first past the post, for example), to careful control of the definition of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; (landowners, heads of households, especially loud fools, etc). I recommend you borrow ideas from this, but skip it for the most part, as even though it promotes individual governance, it is an incredible quagmire and a great way to put the loudest and least-sane members of your society in charge.</em></p>
<p><em>Surt primarily follows what is traditionally called a &ldquo;despotism&rdquo;, where a select set of leaders exclusively make all the decisions. This is less dictatorial than it sounds, as even in these, &ldquo;the people&rdquo; are very good at making waves if you do something they don&rsquo;t like. It is quite similar to an oligarchy, save that oligarchies traditionally maintain power via a wealthy elite, and quite frankly all three of us told the wealthy elite to shove it up their ass at the start of this. Likewise, &ldquo;monarchies&rdquo; are an extension of this concept that trims along genetic lines (and are unreliable as a result). I&rsquo;d borrow from this concept, but cannot recommend it for your people; it limits their say in individual laws too much, and your people have always struck us as very pro-freedom.</em></p>
<p><em>Instead, let me recommend the time-old classic of &ldquo;Republic&rdquo;, where a small number of people try to represent the entire population in all decisions. This usually combines the previous two -- a leader is selected from among the representatives for handling emergency situations, the representatives themselves are selected by direct democracy, etc. As elves, this is often the most suitable option -- particularly if you set term limits, so that no particular position can be filled for too long. I recommend term limits of 100 years, as that&rsquo;s enough to get something done, but not enough to make a term into a lifetime commitment.</em></p>
<p><em>Be forewarned, if you choose any option other than non-monarchical despotism, you are very likely creating rivals for yourself and your successors. That is always the danger of government, and providing guaranteed methods to remove yourself from power always provides people interested in doing just that.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, you also need to consider your economic model. This is oftentimes more complicated than governmental structure, and also more likely to be replaced in the long term; no income lasts forever. Given your situation, I would recommend you start with a Central Planning economy, where the primary governing body controls most of the income within the state (with some limits for allowing individuals to get their own income), and distributes as needed, allocates resources for improving economic sectors, etc. This requires a lot of control, but is a very effective way of protecting your citizens as a whole from economic shortfold. And when you&rsquo;re talking about elves, not only does this control allow for some great long-term strategies, it also protects you from elves&rsquo; infamously long memories (I&rsquo;m 70% certain we&rsquo;re descended from elephants).</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
<p><em>The Hunger</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action 2: </strong>Preparation</p>
<p>The Hunger decides to make another one of the dog&rsquo;s &ldquo;special&rdquo; paralysis bombs. Just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Terror Action: </strong>Find the body</p>
<p>Phoeberon had survived worse; Terror&rsquo;s sure of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She combs the valley beneath Disr for any sign of him or his remnants, and has the Civilie Praesidium (and Tsun unfortunately) look out for Grasp members in the settlements. She rather doubts Phoeberon and Cefali were alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Smoke Action: </strong>Field Trip</p>
<p>The Smoke understands the importance of her scouting duties&hellip; but also really wants to actually be involved in something other than &ldquo;go here and talk to nobody&rdquo;. She wants to <em>meet</em> some River Elves (and not under suspicious circumstances); to <em>party</em> with some Flappy Elves, and not just while trapped in a sandstorm. To get some recognition, and not just for being an errand-person.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind&hellip; she makes plans to &ldquo;hurry up&rdquo; the end of her scouting assignment, and make it back in time to at least see the River Elf Flotilla. And maybe, just maybe, go to the Potluck at the end of this year. Worth hoping, right?</p>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
<h3>Spring Year 4 Results</h3>
<p><strong>Economic- Trade- </strong>Your trading with the river elves goes exceedingly well. The preparations made at Gerdr work fantastically. Barrabus' plan to use local merchants is an excellent idea. Your rising merchant class has been looking for a chance to flex their financial muscles and demonstrate their capabilities.</p>
<p>In fact, many of these merchants have been chomping at the bit to trade with the river elves again. There is no one better for transporting large shipments of bulky or heavy materials, and no one else with greater reach and trade connections. If Surt intends to be an economic power, the river elves will be a vital ally. To that end, your merchants put a great deal of their own resources into making the river elves at home and giving them favorable deals. Overall the trade is technically a financial loss, but the impact is spread out enough that it's not an issue. The connections and networking facilitated by these deals is will be well worth the effort in the long run.</p>
<p>Not only do you receive your <em>Copper Shipment</em>, you will also have a boost die on your next Trade check with the river elves.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment- </strong>Steps one goes extremely well. There is no shortage of entrepreneurs looking to take advantage of the Maar&rsquo;s highly unusual natural resources. There are plenty of ideas for how to use those materials. A great deal of alchemical projects could be completed with them, perhaps on a scale never seen before. It generates a great deal of theorycrafting and open planning sessions.</p>
<p>Actually<em> collecting</em> those materials, well&hellip; that&rsquo;s going to be hard. Not only is the Maar dangerous, the physical labor involved in collecting these materials is brutal. Sulphur mining in particular could shave literally centuries off and elf&rsquo;s lifespan. Fire immunity or no, toxic alchemical substances wear hard on the body.</p>
<p>Hunger is not a monster - at least, not anymore. Neither is Barrabus. They focus planning on sustainable and safer methods of resource extraction. Accounting for using a certain percentage of alchemical supplies to create protective gear for workers is a good start. They may not be able to get the sheer volume of other more brutally direct methods, but in the long term, having a large population of laborers whose teeth and fingers are rotting off due to alchemical poisoning would be bad for their vision of Surt as a whole.</p>
<p>With a few startups beginning large scale harvesting of alchemical supplies, Hunger sets to figuring out how to apply these alchemical substances to coinage. That is going to be very tricky. All of these substances have different melting points and different properties at high heat. Getting them to blend well with gold in high enough quantities to matter alchemically or magically and then getting it to form a cohesive coin is difficult in the extreme.</p>
<p>Hunger still does it. He&rsquo;s a professional, you know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite as good as he had hoped, but he has a viable starting position: coins intentionally minted with fixed amounts of alchemical components mixed into the gold. These coins do have some magic benefits - they can be used as material components for spells with the Fire descriptor and can be used in certain alchemy formulas. As a fringe benefit, they will be almost impossible to forge. This will make them a highly stable currency, and the resulting Aspect could even be invoked to prevent currency tampering.</p>
<p>Sadly, getting the mix powerful enough to work with ritual magic is going to be a <em>huge</em> deal, far beyond the scope of what can be done in half a season. It will likely require more upgrades for that to be possible.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s not a wash. Not at all! Their smaller scale magical attributes make them actually an extremely versatile material component. They can be useful in blending spells in unexpected and interesting ways.</p>
<p>The coins, and shipments thereof, can be Invoked to improve research checks on any magic rituals involving some kind of fire.</p>
<p>You have successfully upgraded the Surtian <em>Fresh Mint </em>&nbsp;aspect to <em>Fresh Mint - Curiously Alchemical.</em></p>
<p><br />Further, the alchemical supply startups have provided some nice surplus of alchemical supplies. These supplies can provide a <strong>boost die</strong> on a check that involves alchemy of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>Legate-Captain Doukas is an asset. He's a hero to some, a bastion of orders to other, and a figure respected by some who respect almost no one. His recognition goes over quite well. Further, creating a new rank and organization system motivates more ambitious members of the military that merit is recognized. It also further distances the fire elves from the blade, as you created a new position entirely instead of bumming a blade elf one. Doukas is a bit embarrassed about the lavish quality of his new digs, but he takes it in stride. Politics, it seem, can't be escaped.</p>
<p>Which is where things get interesting. Doukas has been thinking about many things - things he values, things he wants, things he wants the future to bring. If he can't escape politics, may as well play it his way.</p>
<p>In secret, he invites a few old friends to his mansion. On the surface, just a few elves playing cards and shooting the breeze at their friend's fancy new home. In reality, Doukas is building a power base.</p>
<p>Made up of fire elves that see a lot of blade in them, former loyalists, military men and women, older soldiers and officers, and those who still maintain that deep sense of blade elf loyalty. Unlike many secret societies in Surt, they do not have lofty ambitions. In fact, they only have one goal: Keep this candle burning.</p>
<p><em>In addition to successfully performing the Recovery action, you have also created the Old Guard Aspect in Surt. This secret society of former loyalists and old soldiers led by Doukas may be invoked in a time of great need, as they will do anything to protect the city and the people they love - even at the cost of their own lives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> There is no sign of wolf elves or any other hostile forces in the assigned territory. It would be extremely unlikely for a force to have slipped through, as the heavy dust storms that rolled through recently would have made moving through without leaving tracks very difficult.</p>
<p>If this seems like an abrupt and rushed summary, that's because so was Smoke's report. She has a party to go to! <em>Whoop!</em></p>
<p><em>Don't worry, Smoke's scouting of the territory was quite thorough. However, her paperwork was rushed and incomplete. She left a bunch of unfinished reports and busywork for her subordinates to do. It's an uncharacteristic move for the normally conscientious and attentive elf, but she's had a stressful few months - then again, so have her subordinates&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Due to low morale cuz their boss fucked off to a party and left the boring parts for them to do, any reconnaissance checks next turn will take a setback die.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mental- City Planning</strong>- Hunger hates being right. The CPC is on point for this, compiling and combining an utterly staggering amount of information - raw materials, currency, economic projections, construction rate, food supplies, and more are woven into a complex tapestry of information that tells you one thing: The problem is worse than you thought.</p>
<p>The flow of refugees has been steadily increasing over the last year. With Surt's growing economy, the dark elves' excellent handling of refugees, apparently greater stability in Lock's empire, and greater ease of travel in elven lands, the number stands to increase dramatically in the next few months. Even more so, if Breaker keeps her word and forges a path through the badlands.</p>
<p>There is a rapidly approaching point in time when Surt's current infrastructure will no longer be able to support its population. CPC projections put that point within the next six to eight months. It could be a serious problem. Slums, homelessness, and crime could become major issues, and severely impede future attempts at growth. Worse, with current Surtian citizens enjoying a very high standard of living, major class stratification could become a long term issue.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Hunger and the CPC are able to come up with a plan of expansion. It will use up nearly every single resource Surt has, but it will continue to maintain the high standards of Surtian living and provide for the long term viability of the city. It is a bold plan, a public works project that will make Surt one of the greatest cities currently active in the world, rivaling even old Muspelham. It will push the CPC and the Surtian economy to their absolute limits, but there is no other choice. It's time to grow or die.</p>
<p><strong>Dilemma- </strong>Grow or Die</p>
<p><strong>Timer- </strong>2 turns</p>
<p>The CPC's plan is currently giving you an Upgrade on your next check to grow Surt from Town to City. However, if Surt does not grow by the end of Fall, Year 5 its population will exceed its current capacity.</p>
<p><br />If this happens, this upgrade will be lost and a <strong>difficulty upgrade </strong>will be applied to any checks to grow Surt to City size. This may be mitigated or delayed with appropriate nation level actions, or if an attempt to grow the city fails with significant advantage. If this dilemma goes unaddressed or worsens, it may develop into an Event risking stress damage or permanent consequences to Surtian culture.</p>
<p><strong>Magic- </strong>With a little help from Ink, Fury hass a major revelation. Unfortunately, that revelation is not "how to make the Bad Dog ritual more powerful." What she discovers instead, however, may be of significantly more value in the long run.</p>
<p>While Ink is teaching her advanced arcane theory, Fury invites him to view her ritual preparations and process. While attempting to perform a more powerful version of the ritual, <em>another </em>mishap happens, firing off <em>yet another </em>pillar of fire into Surt's sky. It's purple this time. Thankfully, her safety mechanisms work perfectly and no one is hurt. Fury is a little discouraged that she fucked up <em>yet again</em> and in front of Ink this time, that is until she sees the look of stunned shock on Ink's face.</p>
<p>Ink insists that Fury's team perform the exact same process again, this time giving him a chance to set up some detection magic. Once again the ritual gets out of control (green fire this time!) and once again Ink gets a completely shocked expression on his face. He speaks to Fury in private and explains what is happening.</p>
<p>Ritual casting is different than normal spellcasting. Normally, a caster uses their own innate abilities or skills to harness thaumic energy in their immediate vicinity and craft it into a usable form. A ritual works much the same way, but instead of their own innate abilities a ritual can tap into much greater sources of power such as ley lines, planar weaknesses, extraplanar entities, abstract metaphysical constructs, and the like - at least, that's how it's <em>supposed </em>to work.</p>
<p>Ink has helped Fury discover that she is unconsciously tapping <em>herself </em>as a source of thaumic power. Not only is that not supposed to work, but accidentally doing so usually kills the caster in question and even if it <em>did</em> work it would theoretically be far less powerful than other sources of thaumic power. Fury has apparently been <em>unintentionally </em>shattering those rules for years.</p>
<p>Every time she casts a ritual, Fury taps into a personal well of arcane power in addition to whatever energy she is trying to harness. Fury apparently possesses a shocking degree of innate power, to the point that it shapes all of the energies harnessed by her rituals and amplifies them to an incredible degree. That's actually part of the problem she's been having - she frequently unintentionally directs so much power into a ritual that it overwhelms the other sources of energy and destabilizes the spell. Ink explains that again - Fury has so much innate power that she has been overwhelming and destabilizing ley lines and planar connections <em>by accident</em>.</p>
<p>There is a lot to process with this revelation. First of all, Fury has no idea how to turn this off so it will continue to be an issue. Second, managing that much power is possible, but it will require a good deal more help than she currently has in preparing and performing ritual (hint hint skillpoints.) Third, Fury is not a fool. She has honestly been doing an excellent job at managing her ritual casting considering this huge factor she was not aware of. Fourth, if she could learn how to harness this power on a personal level she could theoretically become one of the most powerful spellcasters ever to have lived, so that's a thing.</p>
<p>Where this power comes from is still a mystery, as is whether this is a side effect of her Phoenix heart or it is something more innate.</p>
<p>On a more concrete level, Fury and Ink develop some practices to better manage her untamed power. Her thaumic energy is, like her, fiery and direct. This may cause issues when performing, say, divination, but can be a huge asset in other types of magic.</p>
<p>So long as Fury is available to perform rituals and not suffering any setbacks, <strong>the difficulty to perform and research direct offensive and defensive rituals with some fiery thematic component is permanently reduced by one, to a minimum of one</strong>.</p>
<p>Fury has learned more about playing to her strengths.</p>
<p><strong>Hunger</strong> is able to reboot his component garden. True to its word, the dog had planted several more azure lily plants. Its last gift, in an odd way. Hunger is able to successfully harvest one and craft another paralytic bomb from it.</p>
<p>Hunger can be generally assumed to be able to replace a paralysis bomb one season after using it, but will never have more than one as the process for creating them is too delicate.</p>
<p><strong>Terror- </strong>Phoeberon is dead. Terror isn't sure what exactly killed him - the fall, the shower of razor sharp voidglass that followed him down, or the freezing cold blizzard that rolled through the ravine the next day, but sure enough she finds his broken and shredded body at the bottom of the narrow canyon. It takes her a while to believe it. What she does with the body is up to her.</p>
<p>Tsun, for once in her life, is a genuine asset. The Praesidium is able to cordon off the villa and do a thorough investigation. They find extremely concerning results.</p>
<p>First, the good news: there is a treasure trove of documents and intelligence on the Grasp left behind in the villa. Someone, probably Cef, used acid to attempt to destroy sensitive documents, but did not have time to get everything. They focused on more recent information, so there is a surprising amount of older information left. Some of it dates back before the Conflagration, so a deep dive of that intel could provide enlightening results.</p>
<p>Second, the bad: The Praesidium is able to get a handle on Grasp iconography and practices. When compared with the Praesidium's extensive documentation of cult activities and identification, they come to the conclusion that there is a strong chance the Grasp is highly active and has been for some time. Grasp graffiti and iconography has been found all over Disr, frequently in Surt, and even in Gerdr. It is unlikely you have seen the last of them.</p>
<p><strong>Smoke- </strong>Oh thank Cal, things went smoothly for once! Smoke completes her assigned patrols on schedule, allowing her to actually *go be social* for once in her life! Smoke may attend the potluck.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have withstood another year in this untamed land! Four years ago, you came here as refugees with only what you had on your backs, struggling to survive. Slowly, you began to build. You created a home. You began to hope. You overcame hardship and violence.</p>
<p>The challenges are not done. The future is not certain. What <em>is</em> certain now is that you are on a path. You are no longer just surviving, you are beginning to thrive.</p>
<p>There are still many ways that things could go wrong - many threats, internal and external, that could tear you and your allies apart. These dangers are real and perhaps greater than ever.</p>
<p>The difference now is that you are beginning to see what the future might look like if you rise above them.</p>
<p><em>In addition to your standard yearly skill point, you have also gained a point of Refresh! It may be exchanged for a new stunt at this time.</em></p>
