<p><em>Fire Elves problems:</em></p>
<p><strong>Creating new problems. Please wait.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Problem in progress: Operation Friendly Fire </strong>[2 economic stress]</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Originating message:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="CoyoteLetter">From: Coyote To: @everyone: "Terms-</p>
<p id="CoyoteLetter">Scrublands are ours. Withdraw military forces, stay out. Hand over Riverhaven. Pay us regular annual tribute. When met, Shadimon released, we suspend raiding towns. "</p>
<p>Demanding tribute from entire nations, and a whole town, for Shadimon&rsquo;s life? After losing one engagement, and &lsquo;winning&rsquo; one by sneaking up on the Flying Elves? A poor choice, and a good indicator of Yote&rsquo;s arrogance. &ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; the Hunger decides, &ldquo;Let us put that arrogance to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, he proposes &ldquo;Operation Friendly Fire&rdquo;, an add-on engagement to help distract from Operation Birdcage. The plan is simple -- provide Yote&rsquo;s &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; at a field location while Operation Birdcage is being conducted, and ensure that said tribute delivers the Marr&rsquo;s strongest export (fire. Its fire.). This *will* actively [inflict economic stress] onto Surt, and will probably lead to problems that will last for months, if not through the year. It will also assist in the recovery of Shadimon, (if done correctly) buy time for the Flappies and Dreamdust elves to build some defenses of their own, <em>and</em> inform the Coyote Elves exactly how the Allied Elven Nations respond to external threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Terror offers to handle the tribute delivery, and proposes the &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; be used as a targeted strike, designed to disrupt Yote military support, recruitment, and training for a period of at least three months. To do this, she proposes that the goods be expensive oils, wines, and stronger alcohols (a veritable raid of the last of the Lycan meads), with a base of alchemist&rsquo;s fire lining the bottom, and eight expensive <em>Fire Elemental Gems</em> at the center. When the supply detonates, triggered by removing the thirteenth bottle from the container (to minimize the likelihood of early trigger or detection), the alchemist fire will catch, the heat and pressure will blow all of the bottles, and the force will shatter the gems, releasing large, uncontrolled Fire Elementals. The number of gallons of liquid surrounding the gems and the trigger will mask them from magical senses.</p>
<p>The Fury, being the most artistic of the group, points out the Coyote&rsquo;s obsession with horses, possibly as a sign of martial prowess. She proposes this &ldquo;container&rdquo; be a complex, well-carved depiction of a Coyote Elf horse, so they&rsquo;ll be more likely to mount it in a central location near their barracks as as sign of martial supremacy. She also proposes that, rather than using scrap metal to promote shrapnel effects, they use jars of sulphur and phosphorus, fine bauxite powder, alchemical air crystals, tar, and rare rusting powder to maximize the &ldquo;horse&rsquo;s&rdquo; heat and explosive potential, and increase damage to the building and to any weapons and equipment that happen to be nearby. After all, the goal is to devastate the Coyote&rsquo;s ability to wage war, not to inflict massive casualties. A hot enough fire will turn their fortress into an oven -- one that can be escaped from, but will leave the fortress unusable and its furnishings ash.</p>
<p>It takes significant resources, and some of the city&rsquo;s best artists; if Operation Friendly Fire fails to have the desired effect, it will be a colossal waste of resources in a conflict the Fire Elves are barely even involved in. If it works, however, it will send a powerful message to the Yote, and at the very least buy the Allied Elven Nations time to build their forces.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure (Investment): Private Beach [the Smoke]</p>
<p> Taking her new position as &lsquo;general&rsquo; over Gerdr&rsquo;s defense seriously, the (as yet barely noticed) Smoke requests resources to build a permanent wall around Surt&rsquo;s newest Village. The Hunger obliges, providing significant concrete resources, and giving her leeway to design the wall as is most defensively appropriate with the resources available. Its a bit of a gamble -- Surt&rsquo;s resources are still strained from building Gerdr last season -- but Gerdr needs permanent defenses, and its a good way to test Grassforest&rsquo;s skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Vita takes to her new responsibilities with serious interest. The concrete formulas the Hunger provides include some very water-resistant insertable varieties; Vita determines that water defenses will be useful, and dedicates some of her work to building gates that will control access to the cove. She aims to build the wall 15&rsquo; high, 5&rsquo; thick, and in &lsquo;sandwich&rsquo; shape, with dirt packed between layers of 1&rsquo; thick concrete plates. If she has time and resources, then by preference, the central &lsquo;fort&rsquo; for defenders will feature a mote drawn off from the lake. Because this is a budget wall, she works it with the contours of the land, rather than trying to smooth the contours around it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Political Action</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery (Taxation): Firebird [the Hunger]</p>
<p>To make Operation Friendly Fire work, the 'tribute' must be composed of luxury goods; the high-potency and valuable alcohols left over from the Lycan Empire, expensive and rich oils that have a high processing cost, and of course the alchemical materials needed to produce the explosive force necessary. To pay for this, the Hunger propose a new taxation initiative, aimed at the merchants who benefited from increased trade with the river elves and last year's festival.</p>
<p>The Hunger proposes it to them as a way to insure regular trade, arguing that these goods will be necessary as part of an agreement with the other elves, that will hopefully limit the Coyote Elves banditry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In return, the Hunger is willing to offer the Phoenix Imperialis increased public and political standing. Right now, they're more a slogan than a political party, but with the right changes in the government, they could be given enough clout to stand toe to toe with the much weakened Ashen. This will likely have an impact on Morale, as the Ashen have a lot of popular standing, but in return, the Phoenix Imperialis is going to shoulder most of Operation Friendly Fire&rsquo;s cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=a04a4470db873300e7a0a08a4896192a">Results</a>: 3 advantage, 5 successes</p>
<p><strong>Military Action:</strong></p>
<p>Military Science (Drill): Flashpoint [Barrabus Leafstorm]</p>
<p>With the Terror out of town, and the Smoke busy managing the defenses to the South, Barrabus Leafstorm (at the behest of the Phoenix Imperialis) takes the unusual step of running a recruiting drive. Personally. Rumors that this is &lsquo;penance&rsquo; from the Imperialis for his vacation are of course blatantly false.</p>
<p>Barrabus puts on a live recruitment concert, featuring both himself, several other local bards, and a number of Firedancer conclaves that he&rsquo;s made &lsquo;strong connections&rsquo; with over the past two years. The Blade Elves are among the first invited -- and as a matter of fact, given front row seating, as some of the other Imperialis coordinators both use them to convince recalcitrant recruits (&ldquo;Look, you want us to rely on the Blade Elves forever?&rdquo;, &ldquo;You think that cute one up front is impressed by your degree in masonry? Pick up a trident, boy, and show &lsquo;em you&rsquo;ve got some fight!&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Ashen are running around in their undershorts while the Blade Elves are showing off actual heavy armor. You wanna be the guy in their undershorts when the guys who make the Blade Elves scared show up?&rdquo;), and attempt to get them to &lsquo;help&rsquo; with recruitment and training, via pointers, tips, demonstrations, etc.</p>
<p>The forefront motivation behind this is, of course, more troops, but the Imperialis&rsquo; true motivation is a bit more sinister. Simply put, they&rsquo;re aware of the Ashen&rsquo;s influence in the military as it is, and they want a few military units they can get into as well. And the Expansionary Guard are perfect for that -- a division dedicated to guarding their trade routes and securing Surt&rsquo;s colonial riches is something they can get behind *and* something they want influence in. Any trainees they get out of this deal are formed into a new Milites unit, and set up to join the EG at Gerdr.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=d3ad7630db077300e7a0a08a48961992">Roll</a>: 2 Advantage, 2 Successes</p>
<p><strong>Mental Action:</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Magic): Hotpocket [the Fury]</p>
<p> The Flappies&rsquo; ritual design is frustrating, and the Fury&rsquo;s curiosity has been lingering. Time for a break from bookwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Fury drafts her arcanists towards testing out the new Deep Scan ritual, focusing on the &lsquo;suspicious lava bubble&rsquo; discovered by Flappy scouts last year. If the lava bubble actually contains something big and scaled, the scan will reveal it (or at the very least, a lair that likely belongs to a big, scaly creature). Plus, this is a good test run for the ritual, which will be used to scan beneath Surt sometime in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The Fury also begins planning for a trip over to the bubble. If there *is* something in there, she wants to check it out personally.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=7d60c73cdbc37300e7a0a08a489619f0">Results</a>: 2 advantage, 1 success</p>
<p><strong>Spending 1 FP to motivate a second Mental Action</strong></p>
<p>Academics (Research): Ill Intent 2: Ill Will [the Fury]</p>
<p> Okay, fun stuff over. Time to get back to serious work.</p>
<p> The Fury is certain she can get this ritual working if she gives it another shot, complexities included. The Flappies&rsquo; version might allow for scanning everybody, but the risk of false positives is still too high, and the Fury is sure she could get the ritual working with just a bit more time to fight with the equations.&nbsp;</p>
<p> If she doesn&rsquo;t pull it off this time, however&hellip; she resigns herself to having to put this one on the backburner. There are a lot of potential rituals to get done, and a lot of areas that need to be scanned with the rituals that *do* work.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev71687.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_339494_mdalpha_rolls.do?sys_id=a2981f34db077300e7a0a08a4896196d">Results</a>: 1 advantage, 2 successes</p>
<p><strong>Character Actions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Terror Action:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>So, the interrogation. There&rsquo;s the unconscious leader. The Terror would prefer to keep their highest-ranking PoW as alive as possible, and quite frankly, he might be more useful later than he is for Operation Birdcage. As such, the Terror asks the Dreamdust Elves to explore methods of interrogation that will work on an unconscious subject -- mind scanning, dream manipulation, etc. The Terror has no idea what the Dreamdust Elves are actually capable of when it comes to brain things, but well&hellip; the rumors of their capabilities with &lsquo;brain things&rsquo; are pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Intimidate (to get some good intel): 35</p>
<p><strong>Barrabus Action</strong>:</p>
<p>Barrabus Leafstorm is not some cheap charlatan spy, relying on a few crummy disguises and a bad accent to get by. Barrabus Leafstorm is an <em>actor</em>. And as such, he must <em>get into character.</em></p>
<p>He tries to use this as an excuse to <em>not</em> be part of Operation Birdcage. Sadly, the Hunger doesn&rsquo;t buy it. Even worse, the Hunger uses it as an excuse to ship him straight to the war front, to get &ldquo;field experience&rdquo; with the PoWs.</p>
<p>Naturally, Barrabus argues that he can&rsquo;t possibly be away too long -- he has a concert to perform! And a recruitment drive! So many would-be soldiers depending on his golden voice and the fascinating motion of his&hellip; knees.</p>
<p>This is how Barrabus Leafstorm ended up on a boat to Riverhaven, still wearing his glam costume, less than fifteen minutes after his concert ended.</p>
<p>Fine. FINE. Maybe he can operate as a subject matter expert. Really dig into these Coyote Elves. Get to know them. Figure out how they tick. Learn their mannerisms. Etc, etc. If Barrabus is good at something, its being a people person (or at least faking it like a madman).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is only one Coyote. And he&rsquo;s not even talking when Barrabus arrives. No matter. All Barrabus has to do is study him -- his clothing, his look&hellip; that&rsquo;s really all he&rsquo;s got at the start. But maybe he can get more once the guy wakes up.</p>
<p>Perception (to study the captive&rsquo;s looks): 21</p>
<p>Sense Motive (to study the captive&rsquo;s mannerisms): 30</p>
<p>Diplomacy (to get in good with the captive): 19</p>
<p>Perform (act) (to become a Coyote): 31</p>
<p>And thus Barrabus Leafstorm becomes Alejandro Murrieta, humble Coyote Elf bard, and definitely not a spy.</p>
<p><strong>Hunger Action:</strong></p>
<p>True, the Hunger lacks a good method for creating magic items (or at least standard ones), and commissioning the creation of these items would be an enormous security risk. However, there is one area of magic item creation that the Hunger&rsquo;s studies have helped him excel at: construct creation.</p>
<p>If he can&rsquo;t find a viable method for using a construct to help manage this situation, he is willing to consider significant retraining. However, it might be possible to use a homunculus to provide this same benefit -- either by giving the homunculus abilities similar to this theoretical bead (or possibly just projecting the transformation onto the homunculus for a time), or by a manner closer to standard for homunculus creation (such as by buying 10 <em>Abeyance</em> potions, forging them into the Homunculus, and then using the Homunculus&rsquo; resulting ability to project that spell to help alleviate the symptoms). He devotes some time to research this option.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the lock itself isn&rsquo;t&hellip; that suspicious. Especially since there are a few legit reasons to have a time-lock system -- as addons to certain secure vaults that are only opened in daytime anyway. The Hunger decides to try and see if he can get a few set up for that, and then take one for his offices.</p>
<p>Knowledge (Arcana): 25</p>
<p>Bluff (to sneak a time lock through for himself): 16</p>
<p><strong>Fury Action</strong>:</p>
<p>Okay, so, let's start with step one: move both rituals *out* of the 'secure storage location' that is the sock drawer. Barry's privacy-violating stunt last year made it pretty clear that the sock drawer... probably wasn't the safe location the Fury thought it was. By far.</p>
<p>So step one is going to be moving the rituals to a more secure location, but still away from prying eyes. The Fury has a few tiles in her chambers pried up, the stones beneath them carefully removed, and the tiles fastened into a clever hinge mechanism. She then purchases a secure lead-lined chest, and moves the notes into there, and then into the new "hiding spot" in her chambers. Which she covers with a rug. And moves her bed ontop of.</p>
<p>Also, she tells the guards to not let Barry into her private chambers again. Its a very awkward conversation. Especially when one of the guards brings up the sock drawer.</p>
<p>Second... initially, her plan was to work more on Governor Droolchin's ritual as she recalls it, using some of her additional experience with rituals to maybe get *somewhere*, but after a few weeks worth of attempts, she finds herself... actively avoiding it. Either because there isn't anything there, or because it brings her back to the white phoenix's suicide attempt... and the part she played in it... and the Governor's plan.</p>
<p>That's why, after a few weeks of fighting with herself, she realizes she might be taking this from the wrong angle. She only has the faintest scribbles from Grabbyhands' modified ritual, but she has a pretty good depiction of the original, and an okay idea of what it was going to do. But in order for the Governor to change it, he had to know what he ritual was as well, which suggests he might know what ritual the phoenix would have suggested. And what's the deal with WP anyway? Why did the Governor have this particular Phoenix chained up for so long, if he was just going to get sacrificed?</p>
<p>And wouldn't it be better to remember him for who he was, rather than just as "this phoenix whom the Governor happened to capture"?</p>
<p>The Fury starts digging. Maybe she isn't ready to deal with the Governor's ritual yet, but she can *certainly* use this time to find out who the White Phoenix was, and maybe what he was actually doing there.</p>
<p>Knowledge (Arcana): 19</p>
<p>Knowledge (Planes): 11</p>
<p><strong>Dogtalk:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><p id="HungerLetter>How much control do <em>you</em> actually have over the change?</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Good Question. Let us experiment.</em></p>
<p>As he reads this the following morning, Hunger's body is suddenly wracked with pain. He can feel the change coming, as if something is trying to tear through his skin. He can feel the dog's form boiling beneath the surface, threatening to overwhelm his mind and body. He quickly asserts his own will, forces the powerful urge to transform down. He remains calm and feels the transformation fade away, along with the dog's attempt to gain control.</p>
<p><em>It seems I have the same amount of control that you do</em>, he feels the dog comment in his mind.</p>
<p><em>And that means I could change, too, should I wish, </em>he replied.</p>
<p><em>Yes, it seems that way</em>, the dog sounded like it was smiling.</p>
<ol>
<li><p id="HungerLetter>Speculation: how easy is it for horses to cross the Marr? Even with experienced riders? Local terrain may function as a defensive element on its own.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>It is worth noting that I don't know any more about horses than you do. I suspect it is as dangerous as it is for any other normal mammal. Dangerous, but not impassable. They might not be able to hide in the Maar, but they can pass through it. Unless they get extremely unlucky, I doubt it will stop them. It is a deterrent, not a wall.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p id="HungerLetter>Further speculation: would it be possible to take advantage of some of the other aspects of the Marr for defensive installations? ...Lava flows and geysers, perhaps?&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Is your plan to distract me with basic questions until you figure out a way to beat me?</em></p>
<ol>
<li>My plan is to avoid losing Surt to a conman running a city of brigands, so <em>I&rsquo;m</em> trying to come up with every potential weapon we could use against them. I thought <em>you</em> had the same agenda as I do. If so, then <em>help me come up with some</em> I just had a thought, but there isn&rsquo;t enough time before moonrise for me to really explore it. Coldwater can&rsquo;t be feeding itself on farming alone, or the raiders would be solely focusing on valuables. If that&rsquo;s the case, every raid we disrupt acts to force an engagement. Firebombing their barracks likely made raiding unviable once. How can we make it unviable for another three seasons?&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Let me be clear. I want to see Surt thrive the same as you. I also do not want to be locked in a closet for the rest of my existence. I am part of you, not your lab assistant, pet, or familiar. I want to be </em><strong><em>free</em></strong><em>, and I will not let us toil in mediocrity forever.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>You want my help? Give me something in return. Give </em><strong><em>us</em></strong><em> something in return. Allow us more freedom. Bring us more greatness. Dampen your fear of our own brilliance. Do that, and I will help all I can.</em></p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Still, we have been improving. I can see that much. So I will give this: the raids can't happen without the Cazadores, and the Cazadors are broken in half. We have bait now, and the best kind of bait: Wounded and bleeding. Coyote won't give up a chance to kill Breaker and her Cazadores if they seem weakened and abandoned. That and we can't trust the mad woman&nbsp;</em></p>
<p id="DogLetter"><em>Keep her Cazadores reeling and wounded. Don't let them recover. When you're ready, use them as bait for a trap. When the rest of the raiders come, we can burn them all.</em></p>
<p><strong>End of Turn </strong></p>
many previously pro-Triumvirate fire elves don&rsquo;t see the point of investing a large amount of their own resources, effort, and indeed artistic talent to essentially light a bag of dog poop on fire on a porch literally almost a thousand miles away. This even drives some previously solidly stable businesselves to the Ashen, as some of them were hit with <em>both</em> the increased taxes and the purchase of their wares for the bomb. Essentially, they believe that the Triumvirate took their own money, used it to buy some of their most precious goods, and then lit those goods on fire for very limited gain.</p>
<p>With all of those factors in place, Tsun sees an opening. She capitalizes on the dissatisfaction to lead a series of major anti-Tirumvirate protests. Immediately the majority of the Praesidium flocks to her side. These will go on for days, weeks, or even months. Tsun publically vows to keep it going for as long as there are blade elf soldiers in fire elf cities. Worse yet, she seems capable of doing so. For the first time, she has major financial backing from Surtian merchants who feel slighted by the Triuvirate&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>Tsun, of course, is not leading an open rebellion. Not yet. The point of the protests so far is demanding that the Triumvirate return to a &ldquo;fire elves first&rdquo; policy. Their primary demand is that the fire elves immediately remove all military support for the conflict with the Coyotes, and supply only limited economic aid to their allies. Due to constant harassment, the swordelves are essentially confined to barracks for the time being, requiring CG escorts to get to their posts without having rocks and rotting vegetables thrown at them. Villhook is doing his best to keep the blade elves in check, but they&rsquo;re getting restless and concerned they may suddenly end up as the focus of a civil war or terrorist actions.</p>
<p>The Praesidium is largely behind Tsun, and those who aren&rsquo;t are too busy trying not to get forced out by the ones who are. The Praesdium&rsquo;s Aspect <strong><em>cannot be Invoked</em></strong> while this Consequence is ongoing. Further, because of the conflict and how overwhelmed the CG is, <strong><em>every cloak and dagger check you make will receive a setback die.</em></strong></p>
<p>These consequences will continue either until the Charred Eagles withdraw and Bravo Division leaves Surt, or until you come up with another solution that ends the unrest. If the conflict and fire elf involvement intensifies, this unrest may worsen. If great victories are won and great economic boons achieved, it may improve. If Tsun and her factions are either sated or dealt with, it may be resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Economic- </strong>Well, at least Gedr is relatively quiet. Thankfully, the unrest in Gedr is pretty mild with only the occasional march or demonstration. Nothing that upsets the flow of things. The more moderate populace and lack of visible blade elf presence means it&rsquo;s mostly business as usual here.</p>
<p>Better yet, Smoke&rsquo;s defensive fortification plans end up being extremely successful. The terrain proves extremely cooperative, <em>for once.</em> The dense granite foundations and sheltering hills around Gedr prove both a natural fortification and an excellent source of materials. Smoke is able to make Gedr&rsquo;s walls with an extremely tough mix of granite and concrete, making them nigh impenetrable. The plans for a moat and gated cove also prove quite viable. In the end, Gedr ends up with some serious defensive fortifications that rival or even surpass Surt&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Not only have you added the <em>Defensive Wall</em> Aspect to Gedr, the <em>Sheltered Cove </em>has been improved to a <em>Fortified Cove</em> as there is easily enough room in it to safely park a river elf flotilla and seal the gates, providing a safe refuge.</p>
<p>However, the conflict from Surt has made a mark. Once again, Vita went a bit overbudget. Normally that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, but it soured relations with some of the merchants in Surt who also suffered a tax hit this year. That, combined with the increasing difficulty of purchasing supplies from Surt means all Economic (Infrastructure) actions in Gedr will have a <strong>Setback Die</strong> for as long as the unrest continues.</p>
<p><strong>Political- </strong>(Note: The Consequence actually removed all economic stress you suffered, technically making this a useless roll. Given the nature of the Consequence, however, and the massive amount of successes involved, I will allow it to have a different effect.)</p>
<p>The Hunger&rsquo;s taxation plan proves to be a serious mixed bag. Technically speaking, it is a success. The taxes are able to cover the costs of Operation Friendly Fire and to prevent any major effect on Surt&rsquo;s economy as a whole. The political impact, however, is a bit dicey.</p>
<p>Some high end merchants are infuriated by this scheme. Notably, there is a group of merchants who had their most expensive stock purchased right after a major tax increase. While no one is put out of business by this, many see it as an underhanded tactic at best and are drawn to support the Ashen.</p>
<p>Hunger&rsquo;s offer of increased standing for the Phoenix Imperialis, however, proves a success. As it turns out, many of the Imperialis fully believe that the Triumvirate's plan has many short term costs, but is critical long term. Look at what&rsquo;s happening - the first major conflict in this new land, and it is fire elves not blade elves who are the tip of the spear. History won&rsquo;t forget this, and they won&rsquo;t forget if you back down or lose. The Imperialis believe that the fire elves are setting themselves up to be a cornerstone of elven culture, and that to step back now would be disastrous. They fully throw their support behind the war effort and do so publicly, becoming more of a genuine faction that defends their interests.</p>
<p>There are mixed opinions on Barrabus. As, <em>once again</em>, he&rsquo;s not present when a major political event is happening. While most still see him as a heroic leader (and his actions during Operation Birdcage support this,) others are beginning to express concern over whether he is reliable enough to be a public leader for the Imperialis. After all, if he had united them and been more proactive before, they might have been able to resolve this already.</p>
<p>Regardless of leadership, the Phoenix Imperialis are finally ready to take a more active role in Surt. Their first effort to address the Civil Unrest consequence will receive an Upgrade. </p>
<p><strong>Military-</strong> It seems that there are cracks forming in Barrabus&rsquo; public image. The concert is a disaster, indeed if not for Barrabus&rsquo;s excellent crowd control abilities it would have been a tragedy. The decision to put the blade elves in the front row turns out to be a bad plan. While things start off well enough, a Praesidium protest immediately flares up at the edges of the concert crowd and attempts to violently push their way through the crowd to forcibly expel the blade elves.</p>
<p>Barrabus is thankfully on stage at the time and is able to calm the crowd for long enough for the blade elves to make their exit before an actual clash happens. There are only a few minor injuries, but attendance for the event plummets over the next few days and continuing protests force it to cancel entirely.</p>
<p>Worse yet, Barrabus leaves town entirely almost immediately after that and isn&rsquo;t seen for the rest of the season. With no recruits made and a black eye on their absent leader, it looks like a loss for the Phoenix Imperialis.</p>
<p>They are determined to make it not so. A group of influential Phoenix Imperialis merchants come together and give a massive monetary donation to the military, with the express purpose of another recruitment drive. They want a new unit that demonstrates their strengths, and they want it fancy. With this boon your next roll to recruit a unit will have an <strong>Upgrade.</strong> Some Imperialis members suggest that it is something showy, not just more Milites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Having spent one full turn Garrisoned at the nomadic settlement and not in combat, the Charred Eagles have recovered from their Fatigue and Exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Mental- Hotpocket- </strong>Getting a little &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; air outside of Surt is helpful at the moment. Fury&rsquo;s ritual is able to complete without a hitch and without interruption by protesters and violence.</p>
<p>Well, first the good-ish news. Fury finds nothing on her Deep Scan that indicates that there is a concealed dragon lair somewhere under the lava lake. Unless the dragon lived completely immersed in magma, it would have nowhere to go. There are no air pockets anywhere down there.</p>
<p>Now the bad news. Deep beneath the Maar lies a massive pocket of magma, pressing upwards. Significantly larger and extending deeper than the area that Deep Scan can cover. The fire elves simply do not have the geological knowledge necessary to make heads or tails of it, but it does appear to be deep enough down that it&rsquo;s not about to immediately erupt. The lava lake seems to have been something of a &ldquo;leak&rdquo; from that lava bubble, but&rsquo;s hard to tell.</p>
<p>This square (and possibly all of the Maar) has the <em>Geological Instability</em> Aspect. Meaning, it is possible for events like this lava bubble or even earthquakes to occur. Predicting them is going to be a whole other question.</p>
<p>Oh, and despite the evidence there are a few more lava monster sightings. Someone swears up and down it was shiny this time.</p>
<p><strong>Ill Intent- </strong>Damn it all, Fury has just flat out overestimated her own abilities. She is once again unable to decipher and adapt the ritual, especially with the complicated requirements she has. The fact that major unrest is affecting her ability to acquire research supplies and personnel is absolutely not helping, nor is the fact that she has to dedicate most of the season to her expedition to the lava lake. Once again, she runs out of time with no progress made.</p>
<p>It may be time for her to admit she is approaching this the wrong way. (Note- Simply changing the wording of when the ward activates does not increase the difficulty.)</p>
<p><strong>Character Challenge: Barrabus Leafstorm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Talent and Will</strong></p>
<p>Coyote may be a dangerous sociopath, but he kind of had a point. Barrabus is at a turning point in his life. Up until now, his role as Phoenix Lord was mostly that of a figurehead - someone to stand up front, look pretty, and get a lot of attention. He was great at that. Now, however, the situation has changed. The Phoenix Imperialis don&rsquo;t need a figurehead, they need a <em>leader</em>. Not just someone who can make them look good, but someone who can be a guiding force in what the Imperialis become. They don&rsquo;t need a pretty face, they need a heart and soul.</p>
<p>With the faction on the rise, there are half a dozen elves who are arguing that they deserve the position. Barrabus is starting to develop a reputation as a flake, a rogue, and worse - an <em>adventurer.</em> These are all well and good for being the subject of stories and songs, but not for being the leader of a major political movement. People want a leader they can rely on, someone who can guide them, someone with vision. Barrabus still has plenty of supporters, but there is a growing movement that thinks he needs to either step forward or sit down. They are a minority, but some Imperialis are demanding he resign his title so that a more reliable leader may take it.</p>
<p>Barrabus has a decision to make. He cannot simply continue to float along as the Phoenix Lord. If he avoids making a decision for long, he will be ousted as Phoenix Lord. If he wants to retain the position, he will need to take a much more active and commanding role in the organization. He will have to make decisions about what the Phoenix Imperialis is, and what they value. He&rsquo;ll have to decide if he&rsquo;s even comfortable making decisions like that. If he doesn&rsquo;t want it, he&rsquo;ll have to decide if he&rsquo;s comfortable with <em>other people</em> making decisions like that instead. Worse, if he steps up he&rsquo;ll have to do <em>paperwork</em>.</p>
<p>If Barrabus is ousted from his position, he&rsquo;ll still be a usable character. He will after all still be a local hero. The Phoenix Imperialis however will come under control of a new character, which you may not be in control of.</p>
<p><strong>Special- Coyote Refugees</strong></p>
<p>Breaker arrives at Riverhaven, battered and weary. She bears numerous injuries, including several severe burns. She's not the only one. Her Cazadores are in rough shape, and they're down many of their numbers.</p>
<p>"We had to fight our way out," she explains, "The hijueputa knew. I don't know how, but he fucking knew I was going to betray him. The bastard turned the horse into a banquet 'in my honor' for 'valiantly defeating the trap and bringing back the loot.' The son of a bitch was using it as a setup to kill me and the ones most loyal to me. He had to have figured out I was going to backstab him and decided to do me in first."</p>
<p>"Well whatever he figured out, the bastard didn't know about the bomb. We set up the thing right in the middle of the training grounds inside the fort. He was planning on surrounding us and cutting us down when we got drunk. Almost did it."</p>
<p>"I had to set the fucking thing off myself. Only my people were expecting it. I got burned bad, and so did a lot of my people, but it fucking worked. Coyote's people didn't know how to react. We had to fight our way out of the fort with hell at our backs, but we fucking did it. They were so distracted by the bomb we even broke open the stables and stole as many horses as we could."</p>
<p>"The whole fort looked like a torch going up. It was loud as hell, too. Lit up half the town like it was daylight. I don't know what that thing was packed with, but without that we never would have made it. The guards were distracted enough that we were able to get our families out safe. We had to charge the gates to make an exit, but we made it. We ran, and we could see the damned thing burning all the way to the horizon. It must have kept Coyote busy, because no one came after us."</p>
<p>"We're torn up pretty bad. We wouldn't have made it much further, civilians or no. We've been through worse, but not by a lot. I'll stand by my agreement that the Cazadores will stay out of Riverhaven, but they could sure use a chance to recover&hellip;"</p>
<p>Breaker has arrived at Riverhaven with 2 units of Cazadores. Unfortunately they took losses fleeing Coldwater. One unit has Light Casualties, one has Heavy Casualties. Both have Low Morale, though that will likely recover on its own so long as their families are safe.</p>
<p>Speaking of, Riverhaven now has the <em>Coyote Refugees </em>Aspect. They fill in the <em>Extra Housing</em>, making that Aspect unusable for the duration of their stay. Thankfully, Coyotes are resilient and resourceful people. They brought a great deal of their own supplies and apply their skills to supporting their presence in Riverhaven, meaning their presence does not inflict any kind of Stress. The dreamdust elves ask them to dress in dreamdust clothing, making it less immediately apparent that Riverhaven took in the refugees. Successful Spying will still find them.</p>
<p>In addition, they brought a <em>Coyote Horses</em> Aspect with them. These are their youngest horses that were being bred for Cavalry. They are light war horses with the Racer archetype. Invoking them to create a Cavalry unit will provide an extra proficiency die. This Aspect can be given to any faction, though it is currently up to the dreamdust elves who gets it.</p>
<p>In return for the economic losses the fire elves suffered, Breaker reports that the bomb caused the <em>Crippled Barracks </em>consequence on the Fort. The garrison at Coldwater is unusable next season, and his forces will not be able to recover from their own casualties or recruit any new units.</p>
<p><strong>Hunger:</strong></p>
<p>Creating a construct could be promising. Hunger's research gives him a little more insight into how the affliction and the "dog" personality work. Essentially, they are the same consciousness. They cannot be separated, and anything that applies to one applies to both of them. This means that a created construct would <em>also</em> obey the dog's orders, as if they were his own. It would have the same alignment as the dog and have the same telepathic link that you would. The transformation can't be projected away from his body in any way, and <em>Abeyance</em> only works once per curse, meaning the ability to cast it multiple times wouldn't really help.</p>
<p>However this does not mean that a Homunculus would be useless. Far from it. A Homunculus is a creature of rules no matter who is in control, and can follow complex instructions - including "do not accept my instructions when I am transformed." It would be extremely helpful to have a set of hands around the lab, as it could operate locks, monitor the dog, and even prepare things like the flower poison or lock bead that could be deployed by it. There's always the risk that the dog could somehow gain control over it, but if you instruct it right that should not happen.</p>
<p>As far as an arcane lock, the Hunger is able to acquire a few of them for secure safes around the palace. He's able to get one for personal use as well, but it causes another wave of rumors about him doing secret experiments and whatnot. Nothing critical.</p>
<p><strong>Fury</strong></p>
<p>The Fury's research leads to an infuriating number of dead ends. In fact, she learns more from what she doesn't find than what she does. Her general research leads to an interesting conclusion. She can't find any kind of reference to a Phoenix being pure white, especially since she doesn't remember him being albino. They are usually brilliant colors, red purple and yellow. There may be some significance to his coloration.</p>
<p>She reviews some of the Governor's notes she found after the Conflagration, but oddly many references to the Phoenix seem to have been deliberately removed. His notes reference to documents that don't exist, and promising parts of the document have been ripped out. He must have destroyed the relevant parts of his notes before performing the ritual, but why?</p>
<p>She is able to piece together a few things. He had the phoenix in his possession for many years, long before she came into the picture. As to why he waited so damned long to complete the ritual, that's not clear.</p>
<p>She is able to find one more thing, on a scrap of parchment that was missed in the purge. His name was Rajska.</p>
