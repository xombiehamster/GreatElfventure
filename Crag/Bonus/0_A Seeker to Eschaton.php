    </p>
<p>A weak wind whips over the mountainside.  You’re somewhat grateful for the reprieve; when the wind gets all high and mighty and artistic and such, it can be a real bother to see through, what with all the snow and sleet and portent it carries.  It’s nice to have a couple days where you don’t have to constantly blink ice out of your eyes.  </p>
<p>You are <b>Jagall</b>, and your body is strong, your pace is steady, and your stomach is complaining.  In this, it shares a common activity with your patrol, who, coincidentally, are also complaining about their stomachs complaining.  Such idle kvetching is a common hazard when running patrols with young Aggro, but you can’t really be angry with them; it is merely youthful exuberance, and the fact that they haven’t yet managed to run over every possible conversation about 300 times.  They’ll get there.  </p>
<p id="purple">“Honey Beets.  Ancestors preserve, I miss sliced, baked honey beets.  I haven’t seen one all year.  I bet the Bakshish are all hoarding them for themselves.”</p>
<p id="magenta">“Hah, you’ll wish it was that simple! I, too, craved the succulent juiciness, but no one can agree on what has happened; I have heard from Temert that he heard an Onagi request that laid claim to the whole season’s crop, what’s left of it, for creation of essential medicines… but I also heard from Krapat… she’s a Samra whose domicile is cross-street mine… that none of her fellow Samra tenders have even seen a honey beet grow in over a year; the line may well be extinct!”</p>
<p id="green">“What?  No.  That is surely ill-informed.  The Elpahka would not allow a gift of the First Generation to be recklessly lost that way.  Surely, they are reserving an urn of beet seeds, at least.”</p>
<p>And around and around the idle chatter goes.  One will mention a desired food.  One will spell portents of doom. One will eschew it.  In a strange way, the repetition is almost soothing.</p>
<p>Of course the conversation is always about food.  It’s a difficult topic to avoid.  All Crag may have been blessed by the Gifts of the Path to endure infirmity, illness, and scarcity, but of all Bloodlines, the Aggro, like yourself, are the most vulnerable to such deficiencies; such large, perfectly shaped bodies demand a toll in nutrition, after all.  That’s why your patrol is out here by itself, rather than accompanied by others, like normal.  You see the sense to it.  Less activity, less nutrition required, more that is made available for the other bloodlines.  It just worries you.  Complacency is what allowed The Extermination to happen.</p>
<p>Speaking of…</p>
<p id="Jagal">“Enough idle chatter.  Attend to.  This is the edge of our patrol.  The ground is uncertain.  Tread with purpose.”</p>
<p>The warning was unnecessary; they have traced this path a hundred times.  Still, it is good to be firm.  Other patrol leads may not be as lax as you.  If they learn discipline now, it will save them grief later.</p>
<p>The rocks grow sharper beneath your feet.  Here, past the common boundaries of Eschaton, they have not been worn by millennia, nor shaped by willful hands.  They are raw, crude, purposeless.  It is a wild... edginess that reminds you of more than a decade ago.  So many strange sights.  So many odd sensations underfoot.  So much raw wilderness.  At times, it was awe inspiring.  You hope never to see its like again.</p>
<p>A wistful look crossed your face.  You know because Emmett, ever sharpeyed Emmett, noticed.  His reaction to your reaction keyed you to your own reaction.  You wonder if there’s a poetry in that.</p>
<p id="green">“...Was it all like this, patroller?  In the… the Lowlands?  So much unused, unturned, useless?”</p>
<p>Your mouth quirks.  You suppose it’s not idle, really.  It’s educational.</p>
<p id="Jagal">“No.  It was worse than this.  A hundred times worse.  The ground was matted with vegetation.  Sod was everywhere. Literally everywhere.  In a thousand paces, one may step on stone but once, and soil and straw for every other step.  Game, big and small, would scatter, untracked, untamed.  The whole of the land was… Primordial.  Unfinished, untended… yes, useless.</p>
<p id="Jagal">But in the name of the Ancestors, though it was filthy with dirt and plant, it was bountiful.  Even untended, vegetation grew large and succulent.  Every night, the stewpots filled with greens, browns, blues, reds…”</p>
<p>You shake your head.  Hah, they got you doing it now.  Clever.</p>
<p id="Jagal">“...But the land and all it’s strangeness still paled compared to the people there.  Not just the Animals, but the others who walked beside us… an unruly assortment of shapes, sizes, colors, and more.  There were these ones, their ears rounded, their features softened; you could barely call them elves anymore.  But then there were the others, who…”</p>
<p>...Second hell?</p>
<p id="Jagal">“...who looked like that.”</p>
<p>A figure trudges in among the slowly tumbling precipitation.  Clad in metal, armed with metal, they shine so bright that few could hope to miss them.  Yet their stature makes clear that they could be no Crag.  It is diminutive, the size of the most common of the degenerate Lowland elves… to your memory, armed as them as well.  Metal weapons and armor were standard among them.</p>
<p>What is it doing here?  How did it find this place? </p>
<p id="magenta">“... is… is that what they looked like?  Eighth hell! I believed it exaggeration, but-”</p>
<p id="Jagal">“Negchat! Batlang! Sight targ, batread, nullcam, lowelf, invec, des A. Targrep, newtargs quineg?” </p>
<p id="purple">“N-Neg!” </p>
<p id="magenta">“Neg!”</p>
<p id="green">“Neg.”</p>
<p id="Jagal">“Ack, mainpos, negchat, draw.  Aroee hosact.  Nullfear, quiaff?” </p>
<p>“Aff!”</p>
<p id="Jagal">“Ack, aff.”</p>
<p>The slip into Batlang is so natural you scarcely notice.  For the others, you can feel their hesitation.  They’ve been drilled as you have, relentlessly, but one always wavers when first called upon to use it in danger.  It will be good practice for them.</p>
<p>You place your hand on the Kuthe at your side.  The Stonebreaker seems a bit much for one lowlander.</p>
<p>It’s spotted you, of that, you are certain.  And yet, it still approaches.  It seems to have a goal in mind.  Surely it couldn’t be heading towards Eschaton?</p>
<p>It… She? Lowlander features are difficult, but you believe she is correct… stops just outside of your reach.  I-She stares at you… yes, directly at you singular, not you plural… her expression unreadable.  Well, she hasn’t reached for that metal weapon on her back.  Funny, it’s bigger than you remember lowlander weapons being.  You suppose they found more metal.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“So.  I suppose you’re the welcoming committee?” </p>
<p>...You don’t think you have a response for that.</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, you don’t need one.  You know what the procedure here is.  All who are sent on patrol do.  You just never imagined you’d be the one doing it.</p>
<p id="Jagal">“Lowl- Outsider.  Your path has taken you into contact with us.  Now, your fate is entwined with ours. </p>
<p id="Jagal">Attend us.  You now follow our orders.  We will take you inward.  There, your fate will be decided.”</p>
<p>She stares at you.  It’s an experienced stare.  Old, worn in, practiced. You get the feeling that this is the way that she Stares at people.  People who are causing her problems.  Most of the people she meets.</p>
<p>There is no promise of submission.  No altered intent.  No resignment.</p>
<p>Your grip tightens on the kuthe.  You feel your tendons tighten, your blood begin to sing.</p>
<p>Then, she sighs, long, hard, tired, and frankly somewhat exaggerated.  It puts you somewhat off kilter.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I do not suppose that it will matter, but just to be completely clear with you lot, all that I want, all that I need, is a place to stay and rest for but a few, short days.  If you aren’t capable of mustering up that basic kindness, then I can just as easily be on my way… and it would be in your best interests to consider that option very carefully.”</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Okay, that kind of response wasn’t really covered.</p>
<p>Well, kind of.  You aren’t sure why a lowlander would be up here seeking shelter, but since she mentioned intention to leave, you at least know where to pick back up. You clear your throat, then speak with more gravitas, trying to project authority.  You may also have projected some spittle.</p>
<p id="Jagal">“Outsider, my statement was clear, my will stoneset.  Your fate is now entwined with ours.  It is only through the Wisdom of Eschaton that your destiny will be decided.  Only those who bear the weight of th-the…AHEM… Bear the Weight of The Tome’s wisdom can return you to your prior fate.”</p>
<p>Eight hell.</p>
<p>Another stare.  Another sigh.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I see.  Of course.  I need to speak to your superior.  And should I refuse to do so, I suppose that there’s probably a violent, foolish altercation promised behind that command?” </p>
<p>Uh-</p>
<p id="Bryti">“And who, may I ask, would be responsible for ‘deciding’ my ‘fate’?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That’s… actually a good question.  You suppose normally you’d take an Outsider to the Aggro Named to be judged, but… but none of them are here.  They are all attending to the Esteemed’s commands elsewhere.</p>
<p>You look sideways to the others.  Commendably, they remain attentive, posture relaxed, but poised and ready. </p>
<p id="Jagal">“Opchat, regcheck, Curractual? Echo, named offsite. Succactual? Firschol, quiaff?”</p>
<p>This is always where it gets hard.  Batlang isn’t great at politics.</p>
<p id="Jagal">“Neg.  Firschol offsite. Baknamed… uh… ditto.  Next actual unclear.  Incap?” </p>
<p id="green">“Neg incap! Aroee! Estalpha clear… obv opcom? Highalpha!” </p>
<p id="magenta">“What?! Are you… I-I mean, Neg! Badtarg! Vuln, poshost, badtarg! Headdam, quiaff?”</p>
<p id="purple">“Headdam?! Badblood! Obv opcom! Nullalt! Negchat, stu-” </p>
<p>You suddenly realize that no one is watching the outsider.  You tear your eyes back to her.  She’s looking between the four of you intently.</p>
<p>...She couldn’t follow Batlang, could she?  </p>
<p id="Jagal">“NULLCHAT! Disgra! Outsider! Your fate will be decided by one of the greatest of our Kin. They are known as…”</p>
<p>Ninth Hell, what is the right call here?  Is she just a traveller?  An infiltrator?  A bizarre kind of assassin who walks up to you?  Ancestors, what you wouldn’t give to know what she’s thinking right now…</p>
<hr/>
<p>You are <i>not</i> <b>The Seeker.</b></p>
<p>You tried to be The Seeker for a moment, but it turns out that’s not a thing you can do.</p>
<p>The Seeker can’t be chosen for the Narrative. It doesn’t work with her deal.  </p>
<p>No, you can’t know what her deal is, either.  That’s just how it is. Get used to it.</p>
<p>Look, you’ll need to find a more suitable perspective.  One you can actually take root in. How about…</p>
<hr/>
<p>You are Elimma, simple Samra extractor.  That’s actually how you think of yourself.  Simple.  It’s not a bad thing, really.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to have a sensible, well thought out, uncomplicated life.  You work the land.  You sense its pulse.  You feel where it is heaviest.  You scrape away to reach the locus of the heaviness. You pull out the heavy blockages, will away the scree, and pass it to the Onagi to forge into something useful.  You return to your domicile, you consume repast, you engage with your fellows, you rest, then you work the land.</p>
<p>See? Simple! Stressless! Comfortable! Every day, you know what you must do, and you know when you are done doing it, so you can prepare for the next day! </p>
<p>Or, at least, it should be Simple.  The Blight, as you have learned it is called, has severely disrupted an essential part of that schedule.  Many nights, your repast has been lean, or missing entirely.  It makes it difficult to rest.  It makes it difficult to work.  You still pour your all into your duties, but you know that, like many others, it has been difficult to will properly.  It’s the hunger.  It saps your concentration.</p>
<p>But it should be simple! And you have full confidence that it will be Simple again! The wisest and most mindful of all Crag are working day and night to solve the problem.  You are certain that it is merely a matter of time before things return to normalcy. You just have to wait.  Simple.</p>
<p>What’s not so simple is the spectacle you’re now beholding.  It threatens to seriously interrupt your schedule.  You really don’t appreciate that.</p>
<p>The Aggro are escorting something.  Maybe someone.  Looking at them, it’s impossible to mistake it for a Crag, and yet it looks so much like… like a shrunken version of a Crag, one left in the sun too long. </p>
<p>All around you, others have gathered, pausing their duties and destinations to gawk at the proceedings.  Like you, many bear weary expressions, drained from their duties, or simply downcast for all their troubles.  Yet, some retain their energy; you hear the chatter of your fellow Samra, and even some Onagi and Bakshish, hushing in whispered tones among themselves, as if to evade the creature’s notice;</p>
<p id="lime">"Is that a dwarf?"</p>
<p id="brightpink">"It’s small… and they are supposed to be small..."</p>
<p id="maroon">"But they are also bearded.  Is it a hobgoblin, maybe?"</p>
<p id="sky">“Pshaw! Of course not, fools! You Samra get that wrong all the time.  It’s clearly a human! Everyone keeps forgetting about the humans! The Aggro told us all about them, the ones who looked like elves, but smaller, and with odd ears.  Look at how odd those ears are, that’s how you can tell!”</p>
<p id="cornflower">“It doesn’t look that odd to me.  In fact, it looks… innocent, almost.  Like a young child, unhewn.”</p>
<p id="darkgreen">“...Where have you seen a child with such a massive cleaver? And made of metal, no less! Pointless!”</p>
<p id="maroon">“Armed with metal, clad with metal. Whatever it is, it is afraid.  There is no doubt.  Only a coward would fear harm so much to dress themselves so.”</p>
<p id="tan">“Do not assume so lightly.  Perhaps where it comes from, only metal is sufficient to protect them from death.  I have heard the Aggro speak of the Lowlands.  It is a violent, inhospitable place. I thank the Ancestors that I do not have to contend with such savage lands. For all our hardship, it could be worse.”</p>
<p>You listen to their words with trepidation in your heart.  You know little of what they speak; you are not a learned Crag, nor have you ever desired to be.  Your duty was fulfillment enough.  But whatever this creature truly is, the fundamental truth is that it is different.  Perhaps, when you were a younger, brash Crag, you would have been excited at the prospect.  Now, after so many lessons about the dangers change brings, you cannot quell your fear that this may be yet another.  Your fear the Crag can ill afford another.</p>
<p>Their destination is clearly obvious; they take the Central Street, after all.  To the center of Eschaton. 
To the Pagoda.</p>
<p>You hope… you <i>expect</i>… that it’s inhabitant will know how to prevent this change from being a burden.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You are the <b>Esteemed</b>, and you are Adrift.</p>
<p>A gentle maelstrom, placid in its fury, whirls before your sightless vision. A thousand frozen memories dance in the periphery, half remembered and half sundered, indistinct, intangible, unknowable.  Before you, the spectrum collides, a bright, unbearable insight, dancing to a silent chorus, all the more deafening for its silence.  A hundred voices fill that silence, corrosion upon your mind, breaking the spectrum, unshipping the truth, an unwanted salvation of-</p>
<p>You feel a nudge.</p>
<p>You are roused.</p>
<p>Miigra, precious Miigra, pushes her snout into your hand.  You once again feel the here-and-now.  The wind dancing across your cheeks.  The waxing light upon your scalp.  The bitter tang of brew, nearly oversteeped, echoes in your nostrils.  But as your mind clears, the reason your faithful conveyance alerted you becomes obvious; you can hear the approach of footfalls, heavy against the steps of the pagoda.  The tread of the Aggro is unmistakable, but the other one, light, soft, but with determined purpose.  The First returned?  No, even his tread is heavier.  Another child, then? But why-</p>
<p>A clinking, a sound you had not noticed.  Metal against metal.</p>
<p>Oh, gods.  Could it have happened again?  You had hoped that you would not have to do this once more.  You had prayed, even, hoping that such a concession would not inconvenience the gods unknowable plans.  But that sound is very distinctive.  Metal weapon against metal armor.</p>
<p>Lowlander.  Another one discovered Eschaton.  And if it was not already slain by patrols… then it is another of your distant kin.</p>
<p>Another fated, one way or another, to die here.</p>
<p>You open your eyes as the sound of their travel reaches its apex.  Any doubts, hopes, you may have had are dashed as you lay eyes on the figure in the center of the group.  Flanked by four Aggro is a figure both rare and familiar; the ears, the eyes, the posture.  An elf.  Distant Kin.</p>
<p>You tune out the Aggro as she makes her report.  There is little she could tell you that is not already self-evident.  Instead, you turn your attention to this burden placed once more in your hands.</p>
<p>She is, of course, small by Crag standards, but though her height may be youthful, her proportions are not.  It is clear by the cut of her figure, by how she holds herself, that she is accustomed to violence.  The armor and the sword were definitely a tip off there, as well.  Yet, if she had intended to fight, she would not have gotten this far.  An odd paradox.</p>
<p>After all, it is not difficult to see that she does not appreciate this treatment.  Her scowl, her impatience are painted upon her face.  Curiously, you sense no fear; rather, a sense of… resignation.  </p>
<p>Perhaps this will not be so difficult after all? Perhaps she has already realized it is better to not resist?</p>
<p>...Or perhaps she thinks herself so capable that even such odds as these need not force her hand.</p>
<p>You wish you could be more certain that such confidence would be misplaced.</p>
<p>The Aggro has finished talking.  Best not to leave them in anticipation.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“You have done well, Stout Aggro.  Your actions were appropriate.  You will remain here, until relieved.”</p>
<p>You know what comes next.  The grand pronouncement.  The declaration of intent.  The dire choice. </p>
<p>...You suddenly feel so very tired. You close your eyes and inhale, the soon-ruined brew distracting you.</p>
<p>Perhaps…</p>
<hr/>
<p>You are <i>in pain</i>.</p>
<p>No, your name isn’t Inpain, although that would fit the traditional scheme.  Actually, you are <b>Granit Bernotich</b>, but that’s really not at the forefront of your thoughts so much as your <i>quince-damned ankle</i>.</p>
<p>Inthell, but it makes it somewhat difficult to have an internal monologue.  You suppose, poignantly, that it’s just another one of your rewards for becoming a senret, like this guard position, although you suppose that of the things you could be guarding, being responsible for the safety of The Esteemed is a task befitting the valiant bloodname of Bernot.  You wonder how much longer you’ll be able to retain it.</p>
<p>However, current events force you to shove your pain, and introspective exposition, to the back of your mind;  while you have never before witnessed a Lowlander apprehended like this, brought in to maintain your isolation, but you had heard the stories from one of your tutors who had; according to her, the situation rarely ended on a happy note.  </p>
<p>The fact that this most recent subject was apprehended, and brought, armed and armored to the teeth further sharpens your focus.  While you doubt that such a small warrior would be capable of stopping both you, your companion guard, and four aggro fresh from patrol, you know all too well that even an outnumbered opponent can take one or two with them if approached carelessly.  You resolve that, even with your advanced age, you will not be one of them.</p>
<p>Here it comes.  The Esteemed has opened her eyes again.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Would you like some Brew, young one?  Your timing is fortuitous, this pot has just completed its steep.”</p>
<p>…What?</p>
<p>Oooh, you get it.  Of course.  The Esteemed has done this before.  More than once, if the old stories are to be trusted.  While it is not the prescribed procedure… at least, not as you were instructed… with a target so armed it may be better to put them off guard before telling them of their fate.  Clever. Wise, even.</p>
<p>However, it seems that if that was her intent, it only worked somewhat; while the Lowlander elf has relaxed, it is only by a small amount. </p>
<p id="Bryti">“...Yes.  I would appreciate a show of basic courtesy.  Thank you.”</p>
<p>With practiced, fluid actions, the Esteemed decants her Brew the same way she has, the same way you’ve seen, tens of thousands of times before. </p>
<p>The Brewpot is removed from the heated stone upon which it rests, placed onto a thick pad of woven darkleaf, still mostly intact despite years of use. </p>
<p>The Brewpot spout is opened, allowing the trapped steam to escape in a rapid rush.</p>
<p>The Flask is placed before the Brewpot, its lid removed.  Unlike most, she does not place a cloth to strain the Frond particulates; while unpalatably bitter to most, the Esteemed prefers their presence.</p>
<p>The liquid is poured from the Brewpot into the Flask, the Brew the color and opacity of jasper. Within the brewpot, only a smudge of plant matter and the wilted stems remain, her sole concession to straining.</p>
<p>A lid placed upon the Flask, and lightly swirled, to distribute the Frond particulates evenly.</p>
<p>The lid removed, and the Brew decanted into the Bowl, where it steams in the air, filling even the open air pagoda with its powerful scent.  You have gotten used to it.</p>
<p>The second bowl, often ignored, sees use, as a dose is poured out in front of the Lowlander.</p>
<p>And then, slowly, carefully, almost reverently, the Esteemed lifts the bowl to her lips, taking a long, deep draught.  The Lowlander, for her part, eyes the brew with some hesitance; you can see her tiny nose wrinkle in response to the smell.  Frankly, you don’t blame her.  You wouldn’t touch the stuff even if it were properly strained.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“So.  I take it you are the one of which your… guards spoke.  The one who is to ‘decide my fate’? ”</p>
<p>Ah, so she’s already aware.  If she’s not making much of a fuss now, then maybe this won’t be as violent as you expected.  Still, no one ever regretted being overly cautious.  You tighten your grip on your Stonebreaker.  While the head of it still rests at your feet, in ceremonial stand, you have many hours of practice using it from this position.  She would never see it coming.</p>
<p>The Esteemed, for her part, lowers her bowl, and cracks her eyes open.  Her glance makes it clear that the Lowlander should continue.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“In that case, I hope that you can give me a more reasonable answer than I’ve received so far.  I don’t wish to bring harm to you, or any of your people.  I mean no trouble or problems.  I’m just looking for somewhere to stop and rest for a couple of days before I continue on my way.  My journeys have been long and arduous, as you can probably guess; travelling across mountains is rarely an easy task, even in the best of conditions.  If you cannot or will not allow that, then just let me be on my way.  I have further to go, and though I would prefer to rest, I am no stranger to hardship.  I am fully prepared to continue on, no matter how difficult anything… or anyone… may make it for me.</p>
<p id="Bryti">So, with out of the way… what is my ‘fate’ to be?”</p>
<p>You feel your lip curl into a frown.  While an ignorant Lowlander, it shocks you to see such disrespect.  Does this petulant child know nothing?  Perhaps you should-</p>
<p>The Esteemed issues a sharp humming noise.  The question in its tone is plain for all to hear.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“A curious claim, young one.  The path that you travel is not merely difficult; it is arduous, perhaps even foolish, for one not accustomed to these climes.  There are many who attempt to travel across such terrain who do not manage to return, even among our kind.  And yet, not only have you survived these travails so far, but you have managed to find yourself here, in our home among the clouds.  </p>
<p id="Esteemed">So tell me, young elf; was our home the destination of your journey?  Or was it mere… fortune, that placed you at our gates?”</p>
<p>The stranger seems to be given pause by that question.  Hardly surprising; few can recover blithely when caught red handed.  You can only guess at what she hoped to achieve here; espionage leaps to the front of your mind, but if that’s the case, she’s certainly not acting like it.  Or perhaps she is?  If you know one thing about Lowlanders, it is that they are, to the elf, insane.</p>
<p>While silence lingers in the pagoda, the stranger takes careful hold of the bowl.  Emulating the Esteemed, she lifts it slowly to her lips, and, to your surprise, manages to sup the bitter brew without hesitation.  You have to admit, that impresses you.</p>
<p>When she lowers the bowl, she seems to have her response prepared.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I did not know of this place, but observed it by coincidence in pursuit of my own tasks. I was merely curious as to who lived all the way up here.”</p>
<p>What?  That’s ridiculo-</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“I see. You are not the first to find this place.  Not even the first in my time."</p>
<p>Oho.  So the old stories are true.  </p>
<p>Of course, the Esteemed has seen through this Lowlander’s lies.  Her deep gaze at this strange elf tells you that much.  You can see her stare boring through the young elf, digging deep, yielding the deep truths.  For her part, the young elf seems to be keeping her composure, but it is only a facade.  By now, she must know that the truth has been outed.  The Esteemed can read anyone, even strange lowlanders, like a Tome.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You are once again the <b>Esteemed</b>, and you can’t get a read on this young elf at all.</p>
<p>Her poise is steady; she holds herself motionless, even while balancing the heavy bowl of Brew in her hands.  And yet, you feel no awkwardness; you get the idea that if you ordered to Aggro to seize her right this moment, that bowl would be yet another weapon she might use in her escape.  That it would be a pointless attempt means nothing; one thing you can read is confidence, and in a bounteous surplus.  The arrogance of youth.  But perhaps, it is mixed with the arrogance of justified arrogance.</p>
<p>You sigh internally.  You have come no further in fortifying yourself to confront her, or her outrageous claims.  Indeed, as the Brew has entered your system, fortified your mind, you begin to think that, perhaps, your hesitance was not merely a lesser cowardice on your part… perhaps it was instinct.  Or something far more powerful.</p>
<p>In any case, if you are to continue stalling to get a proper feel for her, it would help to have a name.  You can only use variations of the phrase “young something” so many times before it starts to feel trite.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Your attention must be commendable, to notice our home so.  Tell me, young one,”</p>
<p>Okay, you needed one more.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“, what is your name?  I would not be surprised to hear that it recognizes your talents in observation.”</p>
<p>She seems unfazed by your accusatory jab.  Instead, she responds plainly, her tone level.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“A name is a dangerous thing to someone of my profession, even when given to those who mean no harm. Please call me the Seeker.”</p>
<p>Of course it would be.  Good to see you aren’t completely incapable of getting a handle on her.  And paranoid about her true name.  That likely means she’s either superstitious… or merely just suspicious.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“A fitting Epithet for one so keenly capable of discovering things.  In similar fashion, you may call me Esteemed, an Epithet I was granted for my Wisdom and Seniority among the Elpahka.”</p>
<p>In spite of having pulled one draught already, you find you must take another, wetting cracked lips and exposed, dry gums.  May the gods banish these terrible dry spells.  They seem to suck all the moisture from your body more readily than any heat.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it gives you excuse to consider your thoughts more carefully.  True, you know what the correct action is.  And yet… there is so much about this situation that seems… unique.  Unusual.  The rules that you readily followed made sense in a context before the Extermination.  But now… now that you know there must be others who have been made aware of the presence of your people, even if they are ignorant of the specific location… it seems almost unwise to cling to it.</p>
<p id="Esteemed"> “Your arrival at this time is both fortuitous, and auspicious, for both yourself and I.”</p>
<p>After all, she did arrive when two of those who she should have been taken to first- Echo, for his position of honor among the Aggro, or The First, for his learned position among the Bakshish- are away.  Had either of them been responsible for her fate, you have little doubt in your mind what it would have been.  Furthermore, she arrived when you had ordered for the patrols to be lightened, to help reduce the burden of the Aggro’s needs; had the patrols travelled in greater number, perhaps she would have been driven away, or goaded into action while still outside the walls.</p>
<p>And, most inconsequentially, and yet most telling; she arrived right before you were about to spoil your brew with inattentiveness.</p>
<p>The gods do not speak plainly.  They do not reveal their plans openly.  They whisper through metaphor, through coincidence, through auspice.</p>
<p>But this?  This is them shouting.</p>
<p id="Esteemed"> “It is always wise to consider auspices. Had your travels taken you here much sooner, you would have been given but two options; to remain here, in Eschaton, where through The Tome we could deduce in which ways you would enrich our people, if any.  Otherwise, you could have chosen death.  Eschaton greatest wall was it's remoteness.  None who are here may ever truly leave again.”</p>
<p>Gods on all sides, she’s still just sitting there, cool as a cave cucumber.  But… perhaps that lack of fear or perturbation is also a sign.  After all, if she did feel guilty for harboring ill intent to you or Eschaton, would not that apparent ultimatum have driven her to action?  Perhaps the same wisdom which has settled upon you is settling upon her, staying her hand from that whopping great steel razor.</p>
<p>You take another sup of your cooling Brew.  You can feel it stiffening your resolve.  Yes.  You can feel it.  This is the correct Path.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Now, that old adage has been defied, time and again.  Once to our woe.  In balance, I can only hope that now, it may be to our weal.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">I would still offer you the first choice.  If you are a Seeker, a traveller, you may be able to help our Bakshish to understand the Lowlands you come from.  We have need of such knowledge.  You would not find life uncomfortable here.  For those who have chosen to remain, they have flourished as all Crag do, well... fed, well cared, well needed as we travel The Path.”</p>
<p>You wince internally.  You tripped up when you reminded yourself of your current food ails.  Hopefully, she didn’t notice.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“However, if you insist that you will only stay temporarily, then we shall grant you succor as you need, if in return, you will answer any questions our Scribes may have.  Though I doubt that a few days would be sufficient to teach us all we need to know, it seems a reasonable price to pay for nourishment and shelter.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">If this is a price you cannot pay, then I give you leave to return to your Lowlands.  I pray that you will think carefully before telling anyone of our existence.”</p>
<p>You finish, feeling magnanimous.  You have defied generations of commonly accepted teaching, but is that not why you were named Esteemed?  Even when The Tome was intact, it did not, could not, answer every tiny question.  It was always the position of the Elpahka, your bloodline, of your predecessors, and now of You to make those calls where The Path was unclear.  To show the way.  To Travel Before.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“Indeed, you are fortunate I arrived when I did.”</p>
<p>Ah, you can see in her posture.  She has relaxed somewhat.  She feels the threat has passed.  She will give you what you have sorely needed.  Insight into this world that soon threatens to invade your isolation.</p>
<p>She takes another sip of your Brew.  You appreciate it.  She’s attempting to impress you.  It’s working.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“Your offer is... appreciated, however my task requires that I not stay here for long.  I am afraid I cannot answer any questions your scholars have. My secrets are not mine to give, no matter my wishes. It seems, then, that I cannot stay here. I... regret my imposition on you.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>Third Hell.</p>
<p>Fourth Hell.  Gods Damn. Sixth Hell.  Ancestors Wept. Eighth Hell.  Inth Hell.</p>
<p><i>Fuck</i></p>
<p>How could you have misread that so badly?  You thought that by bending over backwards with your concession, this child would recognize your unparalleled generosity! Instead, she’s thrown it in your face? She will leave, taking your location… as you foolishly allowed her to choose… and giving you nothing to prepare for the teeming hordes she’ll set upon you?</p>
<p>Gods, please, how many times will this happen?  How many times will you see auspice in nothing?</p>
<p>Only one option remains to you now.  You cannot-</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I will swear to you that I will not reveal your location. I am... experienced in keeping secrets.”</p>
<p>...wait.  Can she read your mind?  Was that a thing Lowlanders could do?</p>
<p>Or… or perhaps you were overreacting.</p>
<p>Of course.  Another important lesson.  The gods messages are subtle.  One should not be distraught for misinterpreting them the first time around.  That she was motivated to soothe your greatest concern just as it was about to consume you is evidence enough that there is still auspice here.</p>
<p>Perhaps, instead, the Auspice is one of Portent; of the Future, not of the Present.  She was not meant to aid you herself.  She was meant to warn you.  She will not be the last.  Others will come.  Perhaps, you must prepare to meet them.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Very well.  Perhaps your auspice was not one of weal, but of warning.  Your dedication to secrecy may be more valuable than your knowledge, in any respect.”</p>
<p>You feel weariness settling on you once more, in spite of the Brew.  Now, you just want to be done with this.  To return to your meditations.  To return to your Drifting.</p>
<p>Let her leave.  Perhaps, it would be best to give her some symbol of your magnanimance anyway.  Something to remind her of how she gave you nothing for something.  It is… petulant, in a way, but yet it feels correct to chide her so.   How else will she learn?</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“The Aggro will return you to where you were found.  Before you leave, they will give you a days worth of simple repast.  It will not be pleasant, but it will be necessary.  A fitting payment for your silence.  Once there, I recommend you leave with all haste.  I can see no benefit to you if you were to tarry.”</p>
<p>Okay, perhaps you ended a little too strongly there.  Still, it’s all you can do to contain yourself.  Yet another example of your mounting incompetence was not what you needed this day.</p>
<p>Odd.  She hasn’t left yet.  She still grips the bowl in her hands.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“May I finish the tea before I leave?”</p>
<p>Well.  That’s unexpected.  What’s worse, the question seemed… sincere.  Not a test, or calling you on your inability to stop her… she wants to legitimately know if she must leave that very moment.</p>
<p>What’s even more surprising is that she should want to drink Brew.  Few other Crag appreciate the drink, even in its more diluted form; the way that you take it, heavily steeped, brewing the whole stems along with the fronds, has been known to make even stalwart Samra ill.  You thought that she drank it at all was an attempt to impress you, to convince you to stay your hand.  Why do it now, when she has gotten all that she will get?</p>
<p>Regardless… you see no reason to deny her.  It’s almost comforting to find another who can appreciate your tastes in this regard.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Yes.  It would not be well to waste it.”</p>
<p>The two of you sit in silence for a moment.   </p>
<p>Your arms quiver, reminding you of the heavy bowl in your hands.  </p>
<p>You lift it to your mouth, draining the rest of the substance quickly.  Although you prefer to let the Brew cool, to increase its bitterness, it would not be good to risk dropping it.  Some show of potence that would be.</p>
<p>For her part, the Seeker sups in silence as well, giving you a level look. </p>
<p>Frankly, you aren’t sure what else she expects of you, or you of her.</p>
<p>And you are so dreadfully tired.</p>
<p>After a while, you let your eyes slip closed.  When she finishes, the Aggro will see to her escort.  Your work is done here.  It is time to rest.  Time to recuperate from the strain of this conversation.</p>
<p>Darkness dances before your eyes.  It is a welcome friend, compared to the clouds you must often endure.  It is easier to forget your infirmities here.  To forget how you are dying.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“Esteemed Elpahka... your people are starving, aren't they?”</p>
<p>Oh, come on. </p>
<p>Child, you got what you wanted.  Why would you do this?</p>
<p>Your general crankiness at this probing question shows through in your response.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“...You give no knowledge, yet ask for it so freely.  A curious position to bargain from.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">Very well, let us start from smaller bids.  I will answer if you answer; Why would you think to ask that?”</p>
<p>She answers readily.  Apparently, she isn’t as done with this conversation as you were.  Still, it is somewhat reinvigorating to have wrested some answers from this damnable enigmelf.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I see it in your people's eyes. I have seen it before, many times. I will not ask for food from a starving mouth. As far as a bargain... I do not come empty handed.”</p>
<p>Satisfaction at her answer wars with the truth behind it. </p>
<p>Crag are made for hardship.  It was one of the first Gifts that the earliest Generations sought.  The mountainsides were never generous in their bounty, but with your people’s hardiness, the amazing gifts of the First Generation, their well tamed flora and fauna, were always sufficient. </p>
<p>Before the Extermination.</p>
<p>Before the Blight.</p>
<p>An answer for an answer.  You must not renege. </p>
<p id="Esteemed">“...Yes.  You have seen correctly.  The fact that it is so obvious to a lowlander marks how deeply this Blight has struck us.”</p>
<p>Wait, Second hell.  You foolish old woman.  Of course, she noticed the hunger, but she didn’t know why.  Not until you blurted it out.  Stupid, stupid. </p>
<p>You need to end this conversation soon.  Before your fatigue truly gets the better of you.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I swore I would keep your secrets. That is something I take very seriously.”</p>
<p>...Maybe Lowland elves can read minds. What a curious trait.  You find yourself jealous.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“That is not something that I can assist you with, but... I do have information that may help you. I know of two settlements, both populated with elves. One far south, across the bay at the mouth of the large river. One west, along the mountains, on the lake that looks like it is on fire. They seem…”</p>
<p>Though your eyes are closed, you can practically hear the scrunch her face makes as she struggles to find the right word.  It brings a flicker of amusement to you.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“...<i>Reasonable</i>.”</p>
<p>You open your eyes once more.  Yet again, you find yourself confused by her claims, and boggled by her actions.  She had claimed to take her secret holdings with the utmost seriousness.  And yet, she just revealed where some of these Lowland elves reside, and her only hesitation was in how to describe them?  Was all of that talk of secrecy a lie?</p>
<p>...Or, perhaps, do Lowland elves not value their isolation nearly as much as you would have believed?</p>
<p>While you can imagine that few of them cleave to it like the Crag do, who would willingly expose themselves to potential enemies by broadcasting their location?</p>
<p>None of it makes sense to you.</p>
<p>And yet, you are concerned that it is beginning to.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I am afraid I have nothing more I can offer you. The information is yours to use as you see fit, if at all. I hope it helps you.”</p>
<p>And there it is.  She was seeking to barter after all.  She just always wished to keep the terms small, manageable.  You can see the wisdom in that, as frustrating as it is.  </p>
<p>Well, it will not do well to come up short.  However, frankly, after seeing her demonstrate just how sacrosanct her secrecy is, you feel generally unwilling to part with any more vital truths of your people.</p>
<p>Very well, then.  A more concrete exchange.</p>
<p>You inhale deeply.  The scent of the Brew is still in the air, but fading rapidly.  Her bowl is empty.  It lingers on her breath.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Did you enjoy the brew?”</p>
<p>Goodness.  She actually smiled.  Point to you, then.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“Yes.  It has been a long time since I had any form of tea. It tastes stronger than I remember.”</p>
<p>...Calling it tea is to call a monsoon a drizzle, but aren’t about to let that jostle you now. </p>
<p id="Esteemed">“I brew the stems in with it.  Few appreciate the taste, but at my age, it is a boon to be able to taste at all.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">You will not take our food, and your reasons are noble.  The Aggro will see you out, and instead of rations, they will leave you with a jar of Brewfrond.  A bitter herb for your bitter experience... yet fitting that you take bitterness from us.”</p>
<p>She bows, mostly with her head, although there is some torso action there as well.  The motion is sharp, precise, perfect.  You recognize it, but in the corner of your eyes, you can see the Aggro tensing.  Indeed, although you did not notice it before, you see that all of them seem tense.  </p>
<p>That escaped you.  Why?  True, the Seeker is… inscrutable, but past the first exchange, there was no threat to her.  Why do they all look so sour?  So on edge?</p>
<p>You are almost distracted from her parting niceties.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I thank you for the gift, Esteemed Elpahka. Bitterness is far preferable to nothingness, on that I certainly agree. Perhaps some day I will be able to tell you how I enjoyed it. May you guide your people well.”</p>
<p>You rather doubt that.  Still, it seems that this is to end on a polite note.  Best to return in kind.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“May you find what you Seek.”</p>
<p>Pithy.  Another point for you.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Aggro.  Do as I have said, and then return here.  I will wish to speak to you again.”</p>
<p>Although sour, when given orders, the Aggro do as Aggro do.  The original four escorts immediately move to surround her, and begin herding her down the stairs.</p>
<p>As they do, you see one more opportunity to get ahead in the exchange of knowledge.  Perhaps it is a bit whimsical of you, but the desire to assert yourself in your home is overwhelming.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Seeker?”</p>
<p>She turns, as do the Aggro.  Their expressions of carefully controlled placidity almost alarm you.</p>
<p>Well, nevermind that. You focus on her inquiring expression.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“...if you include the stems, you will want to steep it until the water turns red.  It will return to a normal color once poured.”</p>
<p>Another sly smile.  Three points.  Perhaps this was a fine conversation after all.</p>
<p id="Bryti">“I will remember that, Esteemed.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>You are <b>Jagall</b>, and you really wish you weren’t.  </p>
<p>It’s not because you had to escort the ‘Seeker’ out of Eschaton.  All things considered, that went about as well as expected.  Sure, the crowds were even thicker as word had spread, but still few would foolishly block the path of an Aggro escort.  No, taking her back to where you found her was easy; Emmett even managed to find a prepared urn of Brewfrond and rejoin you before you left the limits.  Maybe you could have done better to see her off than </p>
<p id="Jagal">“Return now to your lowlands, and go with the Esteemed's grace”</p>
<p>, but you were improvising.  You think that it sounded sufficiently ritual.  You’re no Orator; Stonechime is your Art.</p>
<p>It’s also not because you had to release her at all; while you think that the decision was unwise in the extreme, and cannot possibly fathom what Secret Wisdom lay behind it, you know your part very well; the word of the Esteemed is Stoneclad, and so if she says release the Lowlander, than by the ancestors, you release the Lowlander.  No uncertainty there.</p>
<p>It’s <i>furthermore</i> not because you then had to go return to the Esteemed’s pagoda to be “debriefed” by her.  Certainly, that was uncomfortable, but less because of anything you had to reveal or any decision you had to justify, and more by how informal and clumsy the debriefing is.  Even though she’s the Esteemed, she is Elpahka, not Aggro.  She doesn’t know, does not need to know, the right questions to ask, and how to ask them.  That’s not her essential function.  Awkward as it was, you stumbled through it just fine.</p>
<p>No, the reason you wish you weren’t yourself is because of who you have been summoned to speak to now. </p>
<p> It has been many days since the incident.  No further sign of the Seeker was spotted, even though the patrols were slightly increased in her wake.  And now, you find yourself within the Great Circle, one of the greatest training centers of the Aggro, where young Aggro and trained alike mingle to spar, to learn, to prepare, to move.  Normally, you would consider it your home away from home, for as a Youth it was your home for many years, training and growing alongside  others of your bloodline.  Memories both fond and bitter infuse those mighty halls. </p>
<p>And yet, in this dark room, simply furnished, dimly lit, you cannot recall these memories.  Your trepidation will not allow it.  It is not fear; it is awe.  And there is only one who deserves such feeling.</p>
<p>The figure before you is… inelven.  Enormous.  You are no craglet by any standards, even above the average height of your fellow Aggro, but he towers head-and shoulders above you, head nearly impacting the solid stone ceiling.  </p>
<p>His limbs are massive, bulged by muscle, padded by thick skin covered in a maniac crosshatch of scars and divots, some of them so pronounced as to have been obviously healed without any magic.</p>
<p>But if his arms are a crosshatch, then his torso is a carpet;  massive, wicked scars show where blades and points were plunged, time and time again, into his unyielding flesh.  You have heard that in one battle, he walked away carrying more arrows than any stalker carried in.  And yet, he refused to die.</p>
<p>He is the greatest of your kind.  The Hero of the Extermination.   The Ender of <span class="animal">Animals</span>,</p>
<p>He is Echo of Blood, and his massive features stare down at you, his face a carefully controlled grimace of disdain. His thick, deep green brows bristle.  His cascades of similarly colored hair, shaved from his crown but allowed to flow like a frothy waterfall otherwise, dangles loosely as he leans forward.</p>
<p id="Echo">“And then,” </p>
<p>he asks, his calm voice filling the entire small room, </p>
<p id="Echo">“she told you to release her?”</p>
<p>Quite frankly, you’d prefer to be anyone else.</p>
<p>A sharp wind whistles through the open window.  It promises unrest.</p>
