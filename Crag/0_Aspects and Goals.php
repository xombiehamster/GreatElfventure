    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The fundamental motto of the Crag Elves is that “not all elves are created equally”.  In the wake of Calestros’ Madness, elvenkind has splintered into countless different forms, each shaped by their environments, cultures, and other pressures.  If such differences are possible through only natural selection, then what may be achieved by those with the foresight to use their longevity?</p>
    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p><i>Carved by a Master's Hand</i></p>
    <p>Born of a quest for perfection, the Crag Elves are the descendents of visionary elves who saw their people’s talent for adaptation, and decided to deliberately design a society which would mold the shape of their descendents.  For centuries they hid, high in the Lonely Mountains, severing all contact with outsiders in order to avoid distraction or disruption of their task.  Guiding their actions was The Tome of Physical Perfection. Created by the First Generation, and obsessively updated by those who came after, it chronicled the Vision and the development of the Ideal Elf,  one stripped of frailty, made hard as stone, endowed with perfect bodies to complement their perfect minds. </p>
    <p>It did not take long, at least from an Elven perspective, for them to begin to see the results of their uncompromising vision; adapting to their harsh, mountainous environment, only those who could endure prospered, and with each passing generation they grew robust, durable, and as resilient as the stone they made their homes from.   Truly, they were on the path to Perfection.</p>
    <h2>Trouble Concept</h2>
    <p><i>A Masterwork Unfinished</i></p>
    <p>Though they tried to ignore the outside world, the outside world did not ignore them. Their communes were discovered by the Lycan Empire, who initially saw potential in what they saw, but soon became distrustful, disgusted, and even fearful as they learned more of these hidden elves.  It was quickly decided that no good could come of these unnatural creatures, nor their quest for perfection. and since they would not cease their unsavory practices, the order for their Extermination was issued.  Forced into war to preserve their legacy, the carefully constructed plan housed within The Tome was thrown into disarray.  As communes were found and exterminated or enslaved, critical bloodlines were lost, knowledge was destroyed. Although the Lycans were eventually defeated with the help of distant elf-kin, the toll was a heavy one, for in their final retributive siege, the The Tome of Physical Perfection was destroyed.  The path was lost.  The future is unclear.  The Crag Elves were left incomplete.</p>
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Return to the Path</i><br/>The single most important task of the Crag Elves is to rediscover, or at least construct a new, Tome of Physical Perfection.  Although the damage done by the loss of so many crucial families and traits will by themselves take centuries to repair, the mere act of recreating this essential, practically sacred work will ensure that the Ideal Elf will not be lost to time.  To do so, they will need to retrace the steps of the First Generation, looking among all of Elfkind and charting their development to determine what must be done to gain their strengths.  While the recreation of this document may take decades to complete, the journey of a thousand years begins with a single day.</li>
        <li><i>Set the Foundation</i><br/>The original plan of the First Generation was to give rise to the Ideal Elf in secret, believing that their elven rivals of the time would fear and destroy their work much as the Lycans did.  However, the alliances made during the Rebellion, however temporary, showed that they may be able to coexist among other elves even while pursuing their goals.  If this is the case, they may be able to prepare these and other elves for the Coming Glory that is the Ideal Elf. (Probably not other races, tho, they can, and do, die in a ditch for all we care) </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Milestones</h1>
    <h2>Before the War</h2>
    <p><i>Our Legacy is Set in Stone</i></p>
    <p> From the First Generation of learned scholars, devotees, and laity came numerous subsequent generations, each following the path laid before them in The Tome of Physical Perfection for what traits to favor, which to allow, and which to eschew.  Pursuing this goal in multiple parallel bloodlines, numerous communes and villages were sculpted from the living stone of their mountainsides to serve as the creches for a beautiful ascension.  Among these early communities, the greatest of their kind was Eschaton, where The Tome resided safely interred within the heart of the mount.  The work was long, but each successive generation bore the blessings of the Tome’s wisdom, growing hardy, fit, attuned to their environment.  As they became stone, so to did the stone become them, the very essence of the earth infusing them with potency. </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade:</b>  Our home of stone, our vision of the future, our memory of the past all tell us that only the most durable and long lasting of foundations will endure, providing a permanent upgrade to the <b>Infrastructure</b> skill.</p>
    <h2>Joining the War</h2>
    <p><i>Stone the Crows</i></p>
    <p>The reason for Eschaton and it’s surrounding communes’ remote location was clear; there are those among our elfkin who would have been threatened by the perfection we sought, who could not comprehend it’s majesty, who would have balked at the measures necessary.  No clearer example could be had then what happened when a Lycan prospecting team discovered an outlying commune entirely by accident.  Headed by their winged ilk, their wereraptors, werecorvids, werebats and so forth, these aurum obsessed aerials ceaseless search for material gain exposed their communes to The World.  What they reported back enticed their superiors with promises of fit, capable servants and slaves.  However, once they became more aware of the nature of The Path, the scope of The Tome, they became repulsed, even fearful, at what they had found.  They demanded that we cease, demanded compliance with their Empire’s laws and order.  When their demands were refused, they chose Extermination.  </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade:</b> The lesson learned at the Lycans wings, that we can only trust ourselves to seek perfection, provides a permanent upgrade to the <b>Loyalty</b> skill.</p>
    <h2>During the War</h2>
    <p><i>We Lived in Glass Houses</i></p>
    <p>Though great strides had been made in working towards the Ideal Elf, the path set by The Tome was far from complete; they were stronger, healthier, but not nearly enough to bear the weight of an Empire.  However, in spite of the threat posed by these lycanthropic interlopers, they were confident; their homes were built of stone, their bodies strong and capable.  What need they fear from these lessers?  The lesson taught was hard learned.  Generations of perfecting the physical had dulled the mental, and while a match for their claws and fangs, they could not match the Lycan’s ingenuity, their invention.  Their communes were broken, it’s people enslaved or put to the sword, and with each successive loss the meticulously laid Path they had followed for generations, their very reason for being, was threatened.  In the end, it was only through sheer bloody attrition that the Crag elves survived, the campaign to root them from their homes having consumed too much time and resources from an Empire wracked by rebellion.  As a final act of Dominance, the Lycans utilized their most ingenious engines to cast stones into the heart of Eschaton, and in so doing, destroyed the Crag Elves most treasured item; The Tome of Physical Perfection, generations upon generations of careful planning and learning, was destroyed.  </p>
    <p>In response, the Rage of the Bloodied Generation was legendary.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade:</b> The violence that plagued this chapter of our history will never be forgotten, nor will the lessons learned by the Bloodied Generation which fought it, providing a permanent upgrade to the <b>Conventional Warfare</b> skill.</p>
    <h2>The Post-War Dream</h2>
    <p><i>We Are Uncut</i></p>
    <p>In the years following the final rout of the Lycan’s forces, the remainder of the Crag Elves returned to their high lofts, to the great commune of Eschaton, to see what could be done to recover.  The weakness they bore, revealed by their long, desperate defensive, wore heavy on their hearts.  Even knowing that this outcome was part of the greater plan, now that so much of the path has been lost, will it even be possible to recover?  Can they continue walking the Path, or even return to where they strayed from it?  With each passing year, the answer becomes clear; It is possible.  Eschaton is rebuilt.  The greatest of our number, the wisest, the most learned, are retracing the path of our ancestors, of the First Generation, seeking to piece together what has come before so we may continue our Path to Perfection.  The Tome is gone, but the Crag Elves endure, and though crude they may be now, their people are a diamond in the rough; time, patience, and skillful hands will ensure that their final glory will be achieved, no matter the present cost.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade:</b> Our focus on the recovery of what was lost provides a permanent upgrade to the <b>Recovery</b> skill, natch.</p>
