<p>  </p> 
<p>A wet wind blows across your face; warm and muggy, it carries the scent of bounteous vegetation and pungent decay into your nostrils.  Yet, there is another scent it carries; the unmistakable choke of heavy moisture, the tang of ozone.  By your reckoning, those thick, ponderous stormclouds are just going to barely avoid missing you.  The promise of yet another monsoon hangs thick in the air.  It would be one more of a half dozen now which have plagued you on your journey back to Eschaton.  In spite of all your skills, the weather has succeeded in delaying you, sometimes so badly that even without your escort, you would have been completely incapable of making headway.  Oh, and thinking of...</p> 
<p id="Embebi">“Storm’s coming in,”</p>
<p>you deadpan.</p>
<p id="First"><i>“Fuck me in the eears,”</i> </p>
<p>he deadpans in response.</p>
<p>You laugh at that.  It’s more of a chortle, and you try to suppress it, but you can’t help yourself.  It’s just the way he said it without any fire or energy.  Just a simple, matter of fact expletive.  You have no doubt that earlier in the trip, his invectives would have been far more creative and spiteful, but the poor soul is just entirely spent.  You can’t exactly blame him; there are many Aggro who would have found themselves worn out by the muggy air, the constant showers, and the omnipresent smells of these lands.</p>
<p>Not you, though.  You, <b>Embebi</b>, thrive on this kind of environment.  Although you could do with a little less rain.</p>

<p>You look back over to The First; wet, haggard, a scowl plastered on his face, his dark eyes filled with tired resentment.  Whether for you, the weather, or the entire situation, you’re not sure.  Probably all of them, realistically.  Avoiding your gaze, he scratches at the stubble forming on his forehead; unfortunately, his shaving lith broke not long after leaving the settlement of the Fires, and while you tried lending him yours, he just ended up nearly scalping himself.  Shame, that.  Though you wouldn’t call the look he was adopting <i>good</i>, per se, it suited him better than this sad half-growth.  </p>
<p>You cast your eyes around the environment.  It doesn’t take you long to find what you’re looking for; Seems as though you’re in luck. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Seems as though we’re in luck,” </p>
<p>you echo from your internal monologue, </p>
<p id="Embebi">“decent looking cave, that way.   Should at least give us an overhang to keep dry.”  </p>
<p id="First">“Rapturous bounty.  An embarrassment of shelter.” </p>
<p>His voice drips with sarcasm, but he still turns hurriedly towards the promised protection.  He tugs viciously at the Ox’s reins to guide it along; it complies easily, having learned long ago that while it may think itself stubborn, that stubbornness pales in comparison to The First Among Scholars.</p>

<p>The sky darkens.  Thunder rumbles.  It is a narrow thing, but only the first spurts of rain manage to catch you before you reach the safety of the cavern overhang.  The First breathes a sigh of relief. </p>
<p>In silence, the two of you set up camp; chances are a storm of this size will last all night, and perhaps more.  May as well get settled in.  The pattern is routine, now; between the two of you a fire is lit, sitting mats are laid out, and your dinner, a pair of lowland rodents… one of the ones with all the spines on them, which makes them a pain to skin… are set upon the spit, slowly roasting.  The First eyes them hungrily.</p>
<p>Then, as he has done every night for the entirety of your journey, The First fishes deep within his satchel, pulls forth a sheaf of bound vellum covered in small, precise script, finds a blank portion, and begins to scribble.  You had asked, previously, about what exactly he was up to there; he responded that it was a journal of the Lowlands, a far more meticulous and detailed account than any Crag had ever before penned, which was “sure to bring vast enlightenment to the supposed scholars who had dedicated the whole of their lives to the study of Lowland Esoterica while not once stepping foot into it.”  At the time, you found that humorous.  You had then professed that you had spent a great deal of time in the Lowlands, and offered to help further the cause of Bakshish learnedness.</p>

<p>You’d say that that was the biggest mistake in your entire life, but you had far too many recent examples to choose from to make that call easily.  Still, it definitely ranks up there.</p>

<p>His questions were endless, probing, and often repetitive; if you didn’t know the answer to one (which you often didn’t when it came down to the <i>whys</i>), he would ask it again, in a slightly different way, as if looking at the question from a different direction was supposed to help you suddenly possess new knowledge about it.  Oddly enough, sometimes, you actually did.  </p>

<p>Recently, however, he’s become far more reserved.  You chalk it up to weariness. Or maybe he’s running out of ink.  You have no idea where he was keeping all of it.  Truth be told… you’re somewhat disappointed.  While his attitude is coarse, and his incessant interrogation grating, it was somewhat gratifying to find another soul who saw the Lowlands as… well… <i>interesting</i>.  Not just something to be endured, or be defeated, but something which could-</p>
<p>The First sighs explosively.  Welp.  Time for a tirade.  </p>
<p>However, rather than launching into it immediately, he just stares off into the growing gloom as the rain grows heavier.  Rather than annoyed, as he often looks after such Theatrics… and, being an Aggro, you do not use that term lightly… he just looks tired, but also uncertain.  Thoughtful, even.  </p>
<p>Finally, when he deigns to break the (relative, it is raining) silence, he seems uncharacteristically sullen.</p>
<p id="First">“...How did you even survive down here?”</p>
<p>You furrow your brow.  That’s an unusually open question, for him. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Well, it’s not that hard.  There’s plenty of sustenance, the weather is annoying, not deadly, the critters can be trouble, but most of them outvec fullspeed if you smack their snoot…”</p>
<p id="First">“But how did you <i>know</i> that?  How did you know what sustenance was safe,  how to endure the weather, that animals would respond positively to smacking?  In preparation for this journey, I consumed every tome, grilled every “expert”, even extrapolated from incomplete data… and still, for every aspect I knew to expect, <i>three score and six</i> would be a complete surprise… and that doesn’t even count all of the just plain, boldfaced, unrepentantly <i>wrong</i> information we have!” </p>
<p>He shakes his sheaf of vellum, for emphasis.  A couple fall out, forcing him to scramble for them before the mud-slicked ground ruins them.  This finally manages to coax a few more clever expletives from him. </p>
<p>After collecting his notes, he visibly collects himself.  </p>
<p id="First">“...When you… when the Aggro… descended into the Lowlands, we knew even less than we do now.  It was the Responsibility of the Bakshish to know what to expect, to prepare you for that trek… and it is blatantly evident that we must have failed, completely, and utterly.  And yet, you Descended anyways, and it is readily apparent by your own hand that you not only survived, but <i>thrived</i> down here.  You alone, Stalker, have demonstrated skills and forethought that the foremost of our Esotericists would never in a hundred Generations be able to espouse!  How did you know this?  How did <i>we</i> not?”</p>
<p>You grimace.  He’s vastly underestimating how difficult it was for the Aggro to manage, forage, and fight during the Descent.  But… it would do you little good to challenge him on that point.  Indeed, you see the nugget of truth he’s aiming for.  Better to answer that directly.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“I guess the simple answer is… we didn’t  Not at first.  But Needs Must.  We had a vengeance to seek.  A powerful motivator, that.  There were lean times, but if there’s one thing to be said for this place, it provides plenty of opportunities for Trial of Error.”</p>
<p>You smile at that joke, but he just raises an eyebrow. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“...meaning, we just… did things.  If we were hungry, we gathered stuff that looked like food to eat.  Sometimes, you’d get sick, but not bad, most of the time.  If we wanted more, we’d hunt down fauna.  Sometimes, it’d be dangerous, but hey, snoots turned out to be dependable weak points.  Not the safest or most rigorous tests in the World, I’ll grant, but we got by.  Most of us, anyway.”</p>
<p>He’s still giving that skeptical look, but it’s tinged with something.  Confusion?  Frustration?  Those are the most likely answers, but that doesn’t look quite right…</p>
<p id="First">“ ‘Needs Must’. I see.  No time for experiment, no time to conduct yourself carefully… so you accepted the risk, because someone <i>had</i> to.  Commendable.  If only more Bakshish could think that way.  But that didn’t answer the second part of my inquiry.  You know <i>so much</i> of this land.  Why don’t we?  Did the Bakshish just… ignore you?  As I said, every Aggro is now the equal or greater of our most learned Lowland lecturers, and that is an affront to the very role the Bakshish play! How could this be?”</p>
<p>He’s getting more animated.  Working himself up.  You hold out a palm to forestall him.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“I wouldn’t go so far as to claim such mastery.  I know I’m keen on this realm, but most Aggro… well, quite frankly, after the Descent they would have been perfectly happy to set the whole of the Lowlands ablaze and would have been gratified to forget it ever existed.  I would not be surprised if they would have been hesitant to speak on it, especially back then, when the scars were freshest.  Most of our number had no fondness of this land, but me… well, let us just summarize that I am an odd soul.”</p>
<p>That seems to calm him, but a sour expression… and a fearful one… crosses his face.</p>
<p id="First">“Set it ablaze, indeed.  I expect Echo of Blood was among those.  Seems he got a part of-”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“He never wanted that.”</p>
<p>You’ve tried to avoid interrupting The First… his temperament is even enough if you simply mind your tone, but if there’s one thing that sets him off, it is being disrespected in that manner.  However, you cannot help yourself here.  Curiously, rather than anger, it is confusion that reigns on The First’s face.  Well, may as well take the initiative while you have it.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“The blaze… it was a mistake.  A miscalculation.  You’ve asked how we know so much of the Lowland?  That, in vast availability, is the proof that we plain don’t.  He and others went to strip the Lowland, it is true, but the flames were born of impatience, ignorance… and not a small helping of idiocy, if I’m being full truthful.  As before, it was yet one more Trial of Error.  But that time, Error was our fate.”</p>
<p id="First">“Error?  How so?  His goal was successful.  He provided succor in abundance.  He… was... correct.”</p>
<p>Wow.  It sounded like it actually hurt him to say that.  His teeth are clenched and everything. Now it’s your turn to sigh, although you do so in moderation.  Theater is not your Art.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Aff, he succeeded… but at significant cost.  We made efforts to conceal how greatly we paid; in all likeliness, however you heard it said that we suffered, it was far greater still.  But that is the nature of our kind.  A heavy price, but that is what Aggro do.  It is our Responsibility.  To Pay Prices.”</p>
<p>He is quiet for a moment.  When he finally speaks, he has calmed himself again.</p>
<p id="First">“I see.  That… actually does explain some things.  While I had believed that action to be disastrous, it seems I missed the full extent of why.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Aff.  In all honesty, for all you claim of their ignorance, it might have been best to have had some of your studied number along.  Situation being what it was, I can ken why you would have been… hesitant.  But that knowledge, ill as you think it, may have been vital.  But who can say?  As he himself has said, we can do is try to learn from our Errors.  And, if fortunate, perhaps learn well enough to avoid the Errors before they occur.”</p>
<p>His eyebrow arches far higher than it should, an exaggerated tell.  Incredulity is plain on his expression.</p>
<p id="First"> “Wait.  <i>Echo</i> said this?  <i>The Echo of Blood</i>, he who is known first and foremost for being the epitome of the heedless charge into danger, ignor... ing any potential threat?  He espouses such <i>caution?</i>”</p>
<p>Sarcasm drips from his voice, but again, that note of hesitation. You wonder where such hesitation stems from.  It certainly wasn’t present at the outset of your journey.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Heh.  I wouldn’t call it <i>caution</i>, as such, and I can fullsome guarantee he wouldn’t either.  It’s more a… regret, that he was confounded by something that he once considered a trivial concern.  And now that it’s given him a bloodied nose… and more of us than just him, it is truthful… he considers that <i>ignorance</i> of his to be his most dire foe.” </p>
<p>You waggle your eyebrows, calling out his unusual attempt at diplomacy.  You think you’re starting to get the picture, there.  However, rather than react to your ribbing, he just appears to be distant, thinking.</p>
<p id="First">“...The pursuit of Knowledge, though it is our Responsibility, is a noble pursuit for any Crag.  Though I would not have thought to find it among the Aggro.  But… you alone are proof enough that this judgement was without full merit.”</p>
<p>His thoughtful expression leaves him, replaced slowly by a sly smirk.  When he speaks next, that distant tiredness of his is gone, replaced with that characteristic lecturing bravado of his. </p>
<p id="First">“Well… if you believe Echo to be truly earnest in his desire to banish such ignorance, I would be more than happy to assist… but if I’m being entirely honest, I very much doubt that he’d be able to learn anything from me.  But I <i>might</i> have a useful alternative.”</p>
<p>You roll your wrist.  He’d continue anyway, but this will move his oncoming monologue along faster.  </p>
<p id="First">“As you might have known, were you not otherwise occupied with your ‘opsec’, a great volume of the Lowlander’s discussion was dedicated to the internecine wars in which they must be constantly embroiled.  While I thought it of little concern, as I doubt they bear any true threat to us, there was one thing to emerge from that prattle that might be relevant to Echo’s needs.</p>
<p id="First">You see, one of the subtypes, the Swords… to whose residence you travelled little more than a year ago… are making plans to construct some form of <i>War Collective</i>… a symposium by which all may benefit of their undoubtedly bounteous knowledge of conflict.  While I doubt that Echo may learn anything he does not know about bloodshed, perhaps knowing how these Lowlanders profess to do so may be of some use when they inevitably come looking to shed new blood.  Perhaps this would be a way to test his newfound dedication to the understanding of new concepts, to see how… fruitful he may actually find it.”</p>
<p>Heh.  There’s that wit again.  The way he casually sprinkles subtle insults in everything he says.  The thing is, though subtle, they aren’t exactly… well… cutting.  In fact, it’s kind of endearing the way he so arrogantly states them, as if daring you to get mad about them.  It’s boastful, it’s posturing, and it’s impolite… but that’s hardly an unfamiliar thing for one who grew up among other Aggro youths.  You wonder if they cut deeper for Bakshish.</p>
<p>As to his offer…</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Actually, that has a fair amount of merit…”</p>
<p>After all, such a program <i>would</i> be a way of learning about the Lowlands, direct from the source… And, knowing your Sib, since he’s currently wrapped up in how ‘ignorance’ has become his greatest foe and weakness, it shouldn’t take much prodding and provocation for him to see how much said ignorance could be countered by observing those who live in ‘that maddening place’ day-in and day-out.  </p>
<p>And besides… whether he can learn anything or not… you have no doubt that it would be a finer thing for him to engage with, rather than his current quest.  You can only hope your clandestine instructions to Gustaf went undiscovered...</p>
<hr>
<p>You are everything.  Everyone.  All is before you, and yet it lies beyond your grasp, twisting, convulsing, never still.  <i>Never</i> still.  </p>

<p>It’s not how things should be.  It’s not how things were promised.  You are betrayed, mourning, upset, but nothing you feel, nothing you think, nothing you are changes the cruel reality of existence, laughing, tormenting you.</p>

<p>You pray to the gods for guidance, to see what can be done, who can do it.  Who can do it?  Can you do it?  Who are you?</p>

<p>You are the Layer of the Path, noble, unflappable, diligent.  No, that’s not right.</p>
<p>You are the Echo of Blood, powerful, indefatigable, violent.  No, that’s not right either.</p>
<p>You are the <b>Esteemed</b>… there, that must be correct.  You can feel it resonate, pronounced <i>boldly</i> in your very being.  After all, that is why you prayed.  Because you are capable of nothing else. </p>

<p>Your failures are laid before you, tiled, one by one, like steps in a road, each one a path of foolishness that guides yourself, and all your kin, into oblivion.  You didn’t want this path.  You never pursued it.  And yet, here it is, here you are, twisting into nothing, an ultimate end, in spite of all -</p>

<p>There is something.  Something blocking your way.  A figure, a voice, a will… it is one of these things, or none, or all.  Nothing makes sense.  Nothing <i>should</i> make sense about this reality you find yourself in.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all the senselessness, there is suddenly <i>reality</i>, blinding, deafening, invading your dreadful swirl of nothingness in which you ensconced yourself.  Thoughts ring out in your head, pure, crystal clear, damning, condemning-</p>

<p><i>Esteemed Elpahka - I spoke truthfully and keep your secrets. I request your wisdom. No demand, merely asking. Was I the reason Crag attended the potluck?</i></p>

<p><i>-Accusing</i>.  The voice, the will; the entity knows you.  Knows you more than you know yourself.  And it knows what you’ve done.  What you’ve brought upon yourself.  What you brought upon your people.  It knows the consequences.</p>

<p>You want to deny it.  You don’t want to seem weak by denying it.  You are weak.  You deny it.</p>
<p>But must you be solely responsible?  No. <i>No.</i></p>

<p>“No.”, you plead. “It is not True.  It was The Hunger.”</p>

<p>It tore at your people.  Even tore at you.  It clawed in your bellies, an accusation that would never leave, a permanent mark of your undeniable failure.  You didn’t mean to cause it.  You let it happen. There must be something you didn’t do wrong.  Yes.  There it is.  The Hunger was not the start of your troubles.</p>

<p>“It was The Extermination.  It was The <span class="animal">Animals </span>.”</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.  That was not your fault.  You did not guide their hand to slaughter.  Are you truly blameless there?  Think of all you could have done to forestall it.  All you could have done to avoid it.  How could you have known?  You could have known by being <i>competent</i>. Must you be responsible for even this?  Why do you seek to deny Responsibilities?  There must be more, more that caused it, something other than yourself, larger, greater.</p>
<p>“The ultimate cause is the gods’ Will, Ineffable.”</p>
<p>An Ironclad truth.  You do not command this world.  You do not enforce your Will upon it.  That is beyond you.  That belongs only to the Gods.  All of creation is lashed to their tune, be it dance or dirge.</p>

<p>The voice is silent.  The figure unmoving.  The will evaporated.  Nothing stands before you now.  You can continue into the oblivion you have earned.  Let all that was worked for come to naught, all to save your fa-</p>
<p>Thought booms into your mind once more.  The figure, voice, will are all one now, more powerful, more meaningful… more sorrowful.  </p>

<p><i>I understand. I should not have contacted you. I shall not trouble you or Eschaton again. Thank you for the wisdom and the tea. Goodbye.</i></p>

<p>The malaise that drips with the voice gives evidence to fresh foolishness.  No.  It did not come here to accuse, to blame.  It did not judge.  It wished to be judged.  To be appraised in its actions, to be recognized.   In your foolishness, you thought it an enemy, but it is not.  It is another seeker of truth, a beggar for wisdom.  It is like …</p>
<p id="First" class="whisper">Esteemed?</p>
<p>It is like <i>You.</i></p>

<p>It could <i>Be</i> You.</p>

<p>It is wracked with sorrow for its actions, because you have denied it any part of the fleeting success you <i>did</i> have.  After all, did not that interaction chase away The Hunger, fill the bellies of the Crag people?  Heedless of what the future consequences may be, the fact does exist that those consequences may happen <i>because the Crag are still here</i>.  You have to remember that.  You must communicate that.  You must tell the Entity.  You must tell <i>yourself</i>.</p>

<p>“You do not understand.  Not the Reason.  The Way.   The Means to the End.  The Message.”</p>

<p>Without the Hunger, without the Extermination, the Message would have been meaningless.  It would have been ignored, suppressed, and rightly so, for it would have brought with it more danger.</p>
<p>Without the Message, the Hunger would have consumed all, ending what the Extermination began.  The two elements, Reason, and Means, are useless without each other.  It was only in the singular way that all occurred that the two could have consequence, could have meaning.  It is only with the context of reality.  It is only by the Plan of the gods.  Their Will, ever unknowable, ever elusive, but always there, always present.  This is the Truth that lies behind all things.  And to feel pained at a Truth, that is like…</p>
<p id="First" class="whisper">Esteemed.</p>
<p>… Again, that is like You.  How deeply you despair, but why?  For what reason?  All happens as is intended.  To wail and gnash against what is, what is intended to be, is foolishness.  You must tell the entity.  You must tell <i>Yourself</i>.</p>

<p>“We cannot despair our part of the gods’ plan.”</p>

<p>The figure falls silent once more.  Nothing more is uttered, no more voice comes forth, but you cannot help but feel a sense of… satisfaction.  Both from the figure, and from yourself… though, in truth, in this place they may be one and the same.  </p>

<p>The very thought seems to bring the figure into focus.  The resemblance is striking.  It is a distant reflection of a long lost youth; the certainty.  The bravado.  The strength of form.  Hair, brilliant white, flowing like a waterfall down your back.  It turns to face you, a smile upon its face, a deep smile, a toothy smile…</p>

<p>Something is wrong.  Something nags at you.  Even in this place, there is a sense for what is unreal.  But what is it-</p>
<p><i>The hair</i>.  It is White, shimmering.  But your hair… it was not white in your youth.  It became so in your 400’s, a noble mark of your aged wisdom.  And even then, it was never so full, never so voluminous.  It covers the shoulders, the neck, the face.  One could even describe it as </p>

<p><i>A coat.</i></p>

<p>With one horrifying, lurching realization, context shifts, aspect changes, and truth is revealed.  You were not speaking to yourself.</p>

<p>You were speaking to <i>Her</i>. </p>

<p>In your shock, you take a step back on your sundered path.  A step away from oblivion.</p>

<p>That was a mistake.  You should not run.  <i>That only encourages her</i>.</p>

<p>You run anyway.  Your heart, your mind, your every part of being is suffused with terror.  With sick understanding.  With the haunting reminder of what <i>you</i> allowed into Eschaton.  What <i>you</i> allowed to <i><b>leave</b></i> Eschaton.  You can feel it coming once more, now buoyed by your forgiving words, emboldened, strengthened.  It will come <i>Back</i>.  It will bring <i>more</i>.  And who will be to blame?</p>
<p id="First" class="whisper">Esteemed.</p>
<p>Yes, <u>You</u>. You will be to blame.  You will cause the downfall of everything you hold dear.  And why?  What would cause this?  What could possibly drive you to such ludicrous, suicidal ends?  What excuse could possibly satisfy all the suffering you will have wrought with your careless, <i>incapable</i> mind?</p>

<p>You can’t even think of a response.  Typical.</p>

<p>You can hear the sounds loping behind you, the breath hot on your neck.  You stumble, you trip, you moan with pain.  You are frail, you are useless.  Sprawled on the ground, you can feel the pricks on your skin, <i>this is the end you deserve…</i></p>

<p>Everything twists.  Everything goes light.  You jerk, your body shuddering, as formless nothing gives way to solid reality.  You crack open your eyes, slowly, drinking in the light, indistinct shapes swimming together into existence.  For a brief moment, you catch a snippet of an image, a flowing robe, a sharp point of hair, descending below the horizon of your Pagoda, dropping out of sight.  In the muddled state that reigns between adrift and absolute, you fight to recall all that you have felt, all that you knew, however fragmentary.</p>

<p>Only once certainty reigns in your breast.  You have invited danger to Eschaton.</p>
<p>You must do everything you can to stop it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your fingertips dance upon the surface of the ancient stone.  Worn, pitted, battered by time and the elements, the story it tells stretches past numerous generations.  In spite of the huge gulf of time spanned between now and the stone’s inception, you can feel the small traces of will, the intent of a craftself forgotten long, long ago.  It is a strange camaraderie to feel, but not an unfamiliar one.  For untold time, this stone, one of hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of ones like it, stood as mute testament to the will and resolve of Eschaton, a physical manifestation of the Aggro’s strength, the Onagi’s craft.  Together, they protected the people of Eschaton from those who sought grievance, a bulwark of stone which could not be shattered.</p>

<p>The splash of blood which coats it’s outer face tells you more than you could ever wish to know of how effective this bulwark proved to be against a foe far more bloodthirsty than any other.  To match it, a deep hole, evidence of one of their ingenious engines of war, lies at the epicenter of that crimson mark.  Against such a wound… even the endurance of the Aggro could not prevail.  And against such an impact, even the craft of the Onagi would crumble.</p>

<p>Oh well.  Little sense dwelling on past failures.  The job now was to spin that into future improvements.  That is what the <b>Layer of the Path</b> is supposed to do, after all.</p>

<p>Your hands alight upon the coarse brush… then pause.  There is no need to remove the blood.  It will simply become a part of the stone, soon enough.  There’s probably some significance to that.  Instead, you continue reaching, grabbing a handful of gravel from the bowl nearby.  As you roll the rough fragments of stone in your palms, your minds eye shows you the pits, cracks, and holes present in the sizeable slab of stone before you.  Negative space converts to positive; holes become cones, cracks become thin lines, and all roll together into an amorphous volume of stone.  Carefully, you drop pebble, macadam, and grit into a pile atop the benighted perpend, until you have just over enough… a small amount of excess will file right off, a much easier task than handling for a shortage.  Now, to make them one.</p>

<p>To will stone is one of the greatest arts available to the Onagi, but it is not available to all; to speak to a stone, to convince it to shift and change, requires a tremendous force of will; Stone is a stubborn substance, set in its ways, and only those who can match its tenaciousness can succeed in shifting it.  You are proud to count yourself among those who can will, but unlike how some others describe it, to you it has never been a matter of contest;  for reasons you do not fully understand, but see no reason to question, stone seems to flow easily beneath your hands.  It listens, understands the form it must take, and moves by its own merits to do so.  Even now, you can clearly picture what the stone must do; how it must take the loose scree upon it, incorporate it, make it a part of itself as it seeks to fill its gaps, mend its cracks, become whole once again.  Under your fingers, you can feel the stone flow, tremble, ripple.  You close your eyes, shutting out the distractions of the world;  reality collapses down to but two entities, you, and the stone, each of you moving in tandem towards a desired go-</p>
<p class="biggest"><i><b>SLAM</i></b></p>
<p id="First">“<i>-Ignorant Somnolent Cro-</i>  Oh.  Layer.  I- I didn’t mean to interrupt. My a- apologies.”</p>

<p>As you hear the echoes of your slammed workshop door recede into the distance, you take a deep breath, mentally preparing yourself.  You crack open an eye.</p>

<p>...Sure enough.  Rather than its previous square shape, instead the stone before you is now a distended oblong. Spikes, some of them as long as half a foot, protrude from all across the surface of the stone. Curiously enough, the appearance is not dissimilar to that of a Lowland rodent, one covered in spines, which you once had the displeasure of consuming.  It is completely unfit for purpose.</p>

<p>...Oh well.  The stone it is comprised of is still usable.  Another day, another attempt, and it can still be reformed, put to a proper shape for a proper purpose. This is simply an example of why concentration is of the utmost importance when one utilizes will.  You release your breath.  Some might be able to interpret it as a sigh.</p>

<p>You look over towards the First.  He seems… perturbed, you think.  He is flushed in the face (again, perhaps it is chronic), and his eyes seem to be trailing over the mistreated stone much as yours were moments ago.  While you are no stranger to his tendency towards fluster or dramatics, it seems somewhat more pronounced today.  You aren’t sure-</p>

<p>Oh, yes.  You remember now.  When you last saw him, he was preparing to descend into the Lowlands.</p>
<p>That explains a great deal of his current appearance;  you all-too-well remember how frazzling and unsettling any amount of time in that land can be.  Considering his temperament, it may be best to attempt to be soothing.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Greetings, First. It is gratifying to see that you have returned from the Lowlands physically intact.  I can imagine that it was not an overly pleasant experience.”</p>

<p>His eyes look back towards your own, slightly puzzled.</p>

<p id="First">“What?  Oh, the Lowlands Potluck! Well, no, not overly pleasant, but I’ll admit it was <i>extremely</i> fascinating.  Such a plethora of speciation!  So many little tribal biases!  Though it was a strain, the information collected was well worth the effort.”  </p>

<p>He appears more confident now, likely an affectation.  You can appreciate his attempts at bravado; you had no such inclination to conceal your discomfort, but as one who is Responsible for cherishing knowledge, it would not do to appear afraid of it.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“A triumph for your bloodline, I am certain.  I take it your collection of Lowland Lore was quite sufficient for your needs for some time to come.”</p>

<p>He nods, self gratified.  </p>
<p id="First">“Indeed, although given the unpredictability of that chaotic place, doubtless what I have gathered will be obsolete in mere years, if not <i>months</i>.  Doubtlessly, I will need to attend future occurrences of this ritual in order to remain appraised of goings-on, as well as to further reinforce our understanding of what impact the Lowlands has had on its occupants…”</p>

<p>He trails off, somewhat lost in his thoughts.  You, too, are somewhat lost; while you recognize that you are not the best at reading the emotions of one as bombastic as The First, but...  you could detect no fear or hesitation when he spoke of <i>returning</i> to the Lowlands.  Either his craft at bravado is quite pronounced, or…  honestly, you cannot truly imagine what the <i>or</i> could reasonably be. Perhaps you misunderstood.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“...Do you mean to say you intend to descend back into the Lowlands again next year, First?”</p>

<p>That shakes him out of his reverie.  </p>
<p id="First">“Err, well, yes, of course!  As you and I both know, the Lowlands is a far too transitory place to be satisfied with but one year’s accumulation of knowledge.  Indeed, the study of such a place could be the subject of a <i>lifetime</i> of work… or possibly just a few decades, for someone of significant intelligence, with the appropriate tools at hand… which, I’ll admit, is one of the reasons I wanted to speak with you, Layer.”</p>

<p>He seemed hesitant to bring up that latter subject.  Unfortunately, you have no real idea what he’s talking about; you can confidently state that you’ve entirely lost track of this conversation.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“...To what end did you wish to speak, First?”</p>

<p>Though full of bravado moments ago, now he appears to be more reserved.  </p>
<p id="First">“...Perhaps it would be best if I established some context.  Not long after I returned, I sought council with The ‘Esteemed’ regarding some information of significant import that I was made aware of during my expedition.  However, it seems that in spite of my attempts to engage or inform, she considered said attempts unwelcome to the point of <i>entirely disregarding them.</i>”</p>

<p id="Slabal">“That seems most unusual.  While I am aware that she often has concerns with your methods, it usually seems you have found ways to convince her of their necessity.”</p>

<p>He huffs.   </p>
<p id="First">“...While true, in this instance she did not even engage with my attempts.  Indeed, she seemed to ignore them completely! She didn’t even do me the respect of <i>opening her eyes.</i>” </p>
<p>He punctuates these last few words with a grind of his teeth.</p>

<p>However, that does explain some other things.  This may all be a misunderstanding.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“Ah.  I believe you may have misinterpreted her actions, First. It is possible she was not disregarding you, but rather, was Adrift.”</p>

<p>He raises an eyebrow. </p>
<p id="First">“...Adrift?”</p>

<p id="Slabal">“She has been in such a state occasionally when I have gone to see her.  It is a deep form of meditation, in which she attempts to perceive the necessary strands of future decisions through thorough introspection.  At least, that is what I understand of it.”</p>

<p>Hrm.  He doesn’t seem to be as perturbed as before.  Perhaps you have mollified him somewhat.</p>

<p id="First">“...You have a great deal of trust in the Esteemed, do you not, Layer?” </p>
<p>His words are quiet… conspiratorial.  You’re not sure if you like where this is going.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Of course.  She is the Esteemed Elpahka.  She is the Soul of the Crag.”</p>

<p id="First">“Indeed,” </p>
<p>he says with an odd inflection.  </p>
<p id="First">“, which is likely why you had faith in her instructions… regardless of the True Wisdom they bore.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you find yourself confused once more.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“...First Among Scholars, I get the suspicion that you are circling around a topic without speaking it.  To what do you refer?”</p>

<p>He is quiet for a few moments, not meeting your gaze.  </p>
<p id="First">“Layer… I have been made aware of the communication device.”</p>

<p>That… does not really clarify much.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“Which device is this, First?”</p>

<p>He now looks into your eyes, frustration clear in his expression.  </p>
<p id="First">“There is no more need for obfuscation, Layer.  I know you were instructed to conceal it, likely for fear of some kind of corruption that would be brought by the knowledge within, but given the nature of the Device, it should not be concealed in this fashion!  It is the Bakshish who should possess it, so it’s ability to communicate with the Lowlands can be …” </p>
<p>He hesitates.  It is enough for you to get a word in edgewise.  It seems today is a good day for misunderstandings.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Ah, I understand now.  You are speaking of The Feather, correct?”</p>

<p>His expression shifts.  Perhaps it would be best to clarify totally.  Turning around, you head to one of your small chests filled with materials;  residing within a number of bolts of woven wool, The Feather rests, it’s periodic noisemaking muffled by the thick material.  As you hold it up, The First’s eyes narrow.</p>

<p id="First">“...Yes.  That is precisely of what I spoke.  Please, Layer, I implore you to hear reason; while you may have heard some wisdom which counseled it’s obscuration, whatever that may have been, that Feather can be a far greater Tool than a Threat to the Crag.  If I could but possess-”</p>

<p>Before you can really register what you are doing, you find yourself thrusting the Feather into the First’s hands.  It seems that he is as surprised at your actions as you are; of course, you are somewhat perturbed by the item, having heard many of the Feather’s portents of War and Doom that have flitted unfiltered across it’s communication network, but you hadn’t really understood how upset they made you till this moment.  For his part, The First seems nonplussed at how easily you surrendered it.  Perhaps you should clarify.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“First, I believe there may again have been a misunderstanding.  I was under no counsel to conceal the Feather.  Indeed, the reason I had not reported it straight away after my return is I had not believed that it was actually capable of any communication until it demonstrated otherwise.  At that point, after verifying that its enchantments were of no threat to Eschaton or the Crag, I largely sought to disregard it;  I did not consider that it would be of any particular use to you or your Bakshsish.”</p>

<p>That is largely the truth… however, what you leave unspoken is how foolish you felt that you had allowed such a potentially dangerous item to enter Eschaton’s walls without due consideration.  Likely, the truest reason for its concealment was that you dreaded having to explain your actions and lack of forethought in that regard.  </p>

<p>It is possible that The First can intuit some of this truth, however; in spite of holding the Feather in his hands, he still seems to be skeptical about something.  After appraising it for a moment, he then carefully tucks The Feather into his robes.</p>

<p id="First">“...I have no call to disbelieve your explanation, Layer, and so I thank you for passing this opportunity on to me,”</p>
<p>he says, uncertainly.  </p>
<p id="First">“I will see to it that the device is only used in the greater interests of Eschaton and the Crag people.  I’ll… go see to that, presently.” </p>

<p>With that, he finally exits your workshop, thankfully leaving you to your own devices again.  You do feel a small amount of relief; it seems he was too wrapped up in his new artifact to question your explanation.  Hopefully, that is the last you will hear or see of the item and it’s various portents of doom.</p>

<p>You look back over to the mutated perpend.  Indeed, so heavily did such thoughts of danger rest on your mind that this stone, and many of its fellows, have become your latest project;  hopefully, once they have been returned, cleaned and reshaped, to the Great Walls of Eschaton, ready to stand against the numerous threats you have heard promised, then maybe you will once again find a sense of peace that has been long absent...</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay.  Everything is in order.  Every factoid, every chart, every report from one of the Heads, it’s all been distilled down to only the most pertinent information necessary so that it can be presented in a clear and concise manner.  Now, all there is to do is to actually Present it.  </p>
<p>You’ve done all the preparation necessary.  It’s going to be fine.  You just gotta get in there and do it.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>

<p>Come on.</p>

<p>Just do it.  </p>

<p>Knock on that door, and get it over with.</p>

<p>You know The First is in there, you saw him go in, so there’s no time like now to show initiative, bringing a report to him rather than making him hunt you down and call you in to present it.  It’s good to show initiative, it demonstrates your ambitiousness!</p>

<p>There is no reason to delay any further, so just lift that hand, knock on the door, and lets <i>do</i> this thing.</p>

<p>Yeah! Let’s do it! </p>

<p>Yeah!</p>

<p>Allright!</p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><i>DAMMIT <b>DRIVEL</b> YOU KNOCK ON THAT DOOR THIS VERY INSTANT</i></p>

<p>Finally, you manage to jar yourself into motion, giving three soft raps on the door.  Almost instantly, you can hear a commotion on the other side; it sounds like someone slamming a desk drawer shut.  Moments later, a voice keens through the door.</p>

<p id="First"><i>“Yes? Who is it?”</i></p>
<p id="Drivel">“Err… Uh…” </p>
<p>Oh, good.  Real smooth.</p>

<p id="First">“<i>Drivel?  Is that you?  What do you want?</i>”</p>

<p id="Drivel">“Uhm… well, First, it’s about the crops, you see, and-”</p>

<p id="First">“<i>WHAT?  What are you saying?  I can’t hear a word, Drivel?</i>”</p>

<p id="Drivel">“Err-  Crops… and…”</p>

<p id="First">“<i>Look, just get in here, Drivel, I can’t hear you with all that mumbling!</i>”</p>

<p>Your body works on autopilot, following The First’s demands; with your free hand, you haul open the door and then dance inside, the other tightly gripping the massive stack of notation you brought with you.  Unfortunately, despite your tight grip, it comes to nothing when the loop of cloth binding all of them together gets caught on the door’s latch, tugging it free, then unceremoniously dumping all of your notes across a third of The First’s office.  </p>

<p>Dang.  You purse your lips.  You can feel a general rush of emotion, and try to keep it tamped down.  Slowly, sheepishly, you turn to look at The First, and… </p>

<p>...he’s not even looking at you.  His eyes seemed to be glued to his desk drawer.  You’re not even sure if he heard the spill.</p>

<p>You aren’t sure what to make of that.  Silence reigns in the office for a few moments while you try to process what your next step is; perhaps if you move quickly enough, you can gather your findings, organize them, and-</p>

<p id="First">“Ah, there you are.  Well, out with it, Crag, what’s your business?”</p>

<p>You turn, slowly, to face The First, finding him looking at you… kinda.  He’s actually sort of looking over your shoulder.</p>

<p id="Drivel">“Uhm… Well, First Among Scholars, I was hoping to report to you on the, uh, progress that has been made, with the, you know, experimental crops we’d been growing, and…”</p>

<p>Now, he actually looks at you.  </p>
<p id="First">“Oh, yesyesyes, the Prototypes!  Got nowhere, I’d suppose, kind of a long shot.  Still, valuable exper- what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Oh, drat.  You must have been making a face of some kind.  Well, better own up.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“Well… actually, there is some progress in that area.  A number of shoots have actually taken root.  We’re still appraising, but if we could have some e... some e-extra time to work on it, I feel we may… may actually get some solid results.” </p>
<p>Bereft of notes, you stumble your way through the explanation.  Already, you can feel beads of sweat forming on your back.</p>

<p>The First sports an incredulous expression on his face.  </p>
<p id="First">“...It’s… actually developing?  Has this actually been verified by the Heads, or are you doing all of this yourself?” </p>
<p>Suspicion rings loudly in his voice.  You swallow hard.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Err… Yes, First.  The Head of Herbology witnessed it herself, and signed off on…” </p>
<p>You trail off, trying not to look at the scattered documents at your feet.  You aren’t sure if The First has even noticed them yet.</p>

<p id="First">“Wait, hang on… you mean to tell me you actually got the Head of Herbology to <i>do</i> something?  Other than sit and indulge in <i>herbing</i>, I mean.  How in green blazes did you manage that?”  </p>

<p>...That’s... a question you weren’t really prepared for.  That’s not on a chart or dissertation anywhere on the floor.</p>

<p id="Drivel">“I… asked her to?  I… may have said that if she wasn’t able to, I was meeting with the Head of Arborology later that day, and he could probably handle it…” </p>
<p>you admit, sheepishly.  It was a longshot, but you knew the two didn’t really see eye to eye, and it seemed like she jumped at the opportunity to get one over on him.</p>

<p>The First just stares at you mutely for several moments.  As you watch, his vision becomes unfocused, looking more through you than at you.  You watch, uncertainly, as his gaze travels over to the desk drawer once more, before snapping back to you.</p>

<p id="First">“Well, Drivel, I’d say it sounds like you have this well in hand!  Certainly, you can have more time to see this through, Eschaton was not built in a night after all!  Feel free to report back in, oh, let’s say, a season or so, and we’ll see what the progress is then, yes?  No need to trouble me with the minutia… after all, I have all sorts of things on my plate…” </p>
<p>As he speaks, he slowly trails off, until once more he is staring at his desk drawer.</p>

<p>...You aren’t sure what to make of this.  None of this is going the way you expected or planned for.  You just stand there, stunned.  After about a full minute, The First takes notice of you once more.</p>

<p id="First">“Well, get going, Crag!  Time is knowledge!  Get out there and collect some, hut hut!”</p>

<p>Spurred to action, you stoop down to start collecting your fallen notes.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“Yes, First, of course, First!”</p>

<p id="First">“What are you scrambling at, Crag?  Ancestors Preserve!  Don’t bother with that! Yes, I know the place must look an awful fright, but there’s a method to the madness!  Leave it be, it’s exactly where I want it!”</p>

<p>You pause, mid grab.  For a moment, you consider correcting The First… but only for a moment.  Instead, you leap at the opportunity to get out of this awkward situation.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“Yes, First, of course, First!”</p>

<p>With a desperate lunge, you step over the massive pile of documentation, out of the door, and then somehow manage to wrench it free of the mess in order to close it behind you.  Ordeal completed, you lean against the far wall, head spinning.  </p>

<p>Well, you guess there’s nothing for it but to see how the Head of Floristry is coming with that examination…</p>
<p>A thin wind snakes through the Halls of Learning.  It promises bureaucracy.</p>

</div>
<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic:</b> <i>The lessons of the past, the demands of the future, and the numerous messages of the present all paint a unified picture; though the Crag have managed to survive the Extermination, and rid the land of their greatest foe, there is no shortage of twisted souls who would eagerly wield violence to meet their ends.  The fact that some of these souls are Crag does not escape the Layer.  This fact, and these recent events, have motivated her decisions about where next to dedicate her efforts, and those of the Onagi; the crumbling walls and ruined towers of Eschaton must be built anew, the great Stone Gates must be recast, and even the aging weapons and equipment that find use in the hands of youths in The Great Circle must be tended to.  It is all well and good that a people may survive, but to thrive, they must honor those who stand to protect them… even if that protection must come at another’s expense.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Infrastructure(Enrichment)</b> Skill to replace the aspect Cast the First Stone: Physiological with Cast the Second Stone: Safety on Eschaton.  Building upon their previous efforts, the Onagi once again call upon the Samra to aid in this endeavor, banking on the recuperation and renewal that they have benefitted from thanks to the Onagi’s prior endeavors.  Once again, these strong hands are pivotal in breaking, reshaping, and resurrecting the ancient fortifications; their efforts are Invoked from Cast the First Stone, providing an Upgrade to this check.</p>

<p><b>Political:</b> <i>The Esteemed is ill at ease.  Few of the Elpahka truly understand what it is, exactly, that has her in such a state, but the instructions that she provides are clear.  While few would think it possible that Lowlanders, or other outsiders, could find a way among the Crag people, her advice is simple; better certain than sorrowful.  As such, the Elpahka once again go among the people… but this time, with a keen eye for those who may not be the people.  </i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spycraft(Cloak and Dagger)</b> skill on Eschaton, and this time, it is with all the actions that said skill entails.  As such, they will once more utilize the stunt The Hills Have Eyes, to see if the faithful stones have noticed something awry about any of those who walk along it.</p>

<p><b>Military:</b> <i>Relieved that Echo’s interest was piqued away from his mad quest, Embebi throws herself at the opportunity to discover more of what is going on in the northern reaches… all the better to put a halt to whatever mad schemes her sib may have before they can truly take root.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Reconnaissance(Pathfinders)</b> skill to search the same terrain that was covered last season.  Once again, the stunt The Stone is our Home applies.</p>

<p><b>Mental:</b> <i>When Drivel returns to coordinating the meetings and group experimentation of the Heads of Studies, he is met with even more pleasant surprise; it seems that, for all his capabilities, one of The First’s greatest foils is patience, and when previously confronted with an issue that could not see significant progress in a few mere months, he instead either dropped it entirely, or approached it from a new route.  The message that they would actually continue their research without undue interruption and haranguing is a comforting change of pace.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Mysticism(Creation)</b> Skill to create the technology Lowland Strains(Protatotype)... again, shockingly.  In fact, the fact that this project sees such little interference, meddling, and demands for progress is reminiscent of the slow, methodical pacing to which the Heads are actually accustomed.  As per the progress made last season, this check receives a Boost Die.  Additionally, spending a Fate Point, the Heads  Invoke Our Legacy is Set in Stone, providing an upgrade to this check, hoping to take this opportunity to conclusively prove that slow progress, is still progress.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>Economic-</b> It seems that Slabal is not the only one concerned about safety. Rumors of the growing conflict far to the south have started to spread. Under normal circumstances, the news of a lowlander war many hundreds of miles away would be of no concern to the Crag, but it seems that they are feeling both more connected and more vulnerable than they ever have in the past. Many see it as a question of when not if Eschaton's location is revealed to the world. Slabal finds herself granted far more leeway, resources, and support than she was expecting.</p>

<p>Once again, Slabal delivers on time and under budget. The Aspect Cast the Second Stone: Safety has been applied to Eschaton. Sturdy solid walls surround the settlement. Towers provide layered defenses in narrow passes according to centuries old battle plans. Gates are reinforced, emergency weapons are refreshed, and defensive plans are reviewed and adjusted. Eschaton is defensible once again, a fact that brings great comfort to the Crag.</p>

<p>Slabal is developing a reputation for reliability, efficiency, and stoic dependability. Her quiet resolve is a model not just to the Onagi, but among all Crag. She is quickly developing a standout reputation among the Named, and is seen in a positive light by nearly every Crag. Her leadership will provide a boost die on any further checks to improve Eschaton that she is in charge of.</p>

<p><b>Political-</b> All is well is the word, though it seems Ledret is having a hard time believing it. At first, her concerns are shared by most of the Elpahka. The rumors of conflict and mysterious foes have started to reach even Eschaton, and the results of that conflict reaching the Crag would be plain to all.</p>

<p>However, things… go well? For the first time in many years, essentially all the bloodlines are in good spirits. The Onagi and Samra are satisfied with the progress they are making with the reconstruction project. The Bakshish are actually working together on solving a problem for once. The Aggro are feeling more confident in adapting to their new responsibilities in Crag society, and in addressing their past mistakes. Everyone's… hopeful?</p>

<p>When this doesn't assuage Ledret's fears and she does not elaborate further, the other Elpahka become a bit concerned. They try to convince her that it is acceptable to simply take good news at face value, but for some reason she can't do that.</p>

<p>Ledret finds herself riding Miigra on the outskirts of Eschaton alone on a clear day. She has been asking some of the older stones at the very edges of Eschaton's territory what they have seen, some which have not been listened to in many years.</p>

<p><i>I saw an animal I have not seen before,</i> one of them speaks to her, <i>it was strange, four legged, wide paws, heavy fur, and sharp of fang. It placed a paw upon me, stood still for some time, then turned around and left.</i> It takes some coaxing (rocks aren't the best at animal identification) but Ledret eventually figures it out.</p>

<p>This stone was touched by a wolf.</p>

<p>As she returns to Eschaton she is lost in thought, concerned about the terrible consequences this might bring.</p>

<p>Suddenly she is jerked out of her thoughts by a familiar voice that she has not heard in several weeks:</p>

<p><i>I will heed your words. I must trust the Path my Goddess sets me upon, even if I do not understand it. My gratitude, Esteemed.</i></p>

<p>This… probably does not help her emotional state.</p>

<p><b>Military-</b> Embebi continues her policy of caution and steady progress over dramatic success. She is able to explore the square that forced Echo to turn back, but the increasingly thin air in the northern square makes progress slow.</p>

<p>Frustratingly, the territory that was explored contains little of interest. More of the same mountains. No contact with her "friend" either. Even though she would love to press on to the area that could contain the Crag she's looking for, she takes her time. A major loss of life could destroy all the progress she has made so far. Instead, she focuses on having her Stalkers experiment and train with techniques for exploring at extreme altitudes as this will absolutely come into play.</p>

<p>While these methods prevent her expedition from fully exploring the territory, the extra training will come in handy. Your next Pathfinders check to explore high altitude territory will get a boost die.</p>

<p><b>Mental-</b> Drivel ends up in a shockingly bizarre situation. Everything goes… fine? His hands-off management style has apparently done the trick. By getting the right people talking and making sure the wrong people aren't talking, Drivel has cut out the rough grit that tends to slow Bakshish progress. The scholars work freely and reasonably efficiently, with only one or two ranting arguments a day.</p>

<p>Soon enough, the Crag have their Prototype. They maintain the best attributes of the potato - its hardiness, ease of growth, nutrients, and caloric density - and tweak them to match Crag cultivation method. The result is a hardy and reliable staple crop that could feed many hungry Crag. This diversification could prove critical, as this is a very different type of crop than the Crag are used to and would be unlikely to be vulnerable to the same kinds of crop failures. It is one small step towards making sure something like the Blight does not happen again.</p>

<p><b>News Arrives- Coyote Refugees</b></p>
<p>(<i>While messengers probably didn't come to Escahton I figured you at least would want to know the results out of character.</i>)</p>

<p>Breaker arrives at Riverhaven, battered and weary. She bears numerous injuries, including several severe burns. She's not the only one. Her Cazadores are in rough shape, and they're down many of their numbers.</p>

<p>"We had to fight our way out," she explains, "The hijueputa knew. I don't know how, but he fucking knew I was going to betray him. The bastard turned the horse into a banquet 'in my honor' for 'valiantly defeating the trap and bringing back the loot.' The son of a bitch was using it as a setup to kill me and the ones most loyal to me. He had to have figured out I was going to backstab him and decided to do me in first."</p>

<p>"Well whatever he figured out, the bastard didn't know about the bomb. We set up the thing right in the middle of the training grounds inside the fort. He was planning on surrounding us and cutting us down when we got drunk. Almost did it."</p>

<p>"I had to set the fucking thing off myself. Only my people were expecting it. I got burned bad, and so did a lot of my people, but it fucking worked. Coyote's people didn't know how to react. We had to fight our way out of the fort with hell at our backs, but we fucking did it. They were so distracted by the bomb we even broke open the stables and stole as many horses as we could."</p>

<p>"The whole fort looked like a torch going up. It was loud as hell, too. Lit up half the town like it was daylight. I don't know what that thing was packed with, but without that we never would have made it. The guards were distracted enough that we were able to get our families out safe. We had to charge the gates to make an exit, but we made it. We ran, and we could see the damned thing burning all the way to the horizon. It must have kept Coyote busy, because no one came after us."</p>

<p>"We're torn up pretty bad. We wouldn't have made it much further, civilians or no. We've been through worse, but not by a lot. I'll stand by my agreement that the Cazadores will stay out of Riverhaven, but they could sure use a chance to recover…"</p>

<p>Breaker has arrived at Riverhaven with 2 units of Cazadores. Unfortunately they took losses fleeing Coldwater. One unit has Light Casualties, one has Heavy Casualties. Both have Low Morale, though that will likely recover on its own so long as their families are safe.</p>

<p>Speaking of, Riverhaven now has the Coyote Refugees Aspect. They fill in the Extra Housing, making that Aspect unusable for the duration of their stay. Thankfully, Coyotes are resilient and resourceful people. They brought a great deal of their own supplies and apply their skills to supporting their presence in Riverhaven, meaning their presence does not inflict any kind of Stress. The dreamdust elves ask them to dress in dreamdust clothing, making it less immediately apparent that Riverhaven took in the refugees. Successful Spying will still find them.</p>

<p>In addition, they brought a Coyote Horses Aspect with them. These are their youngest horses that were being bred for Cavalry. They are light war horses with the Racer archetype. Invoking them to create a Cavalry unit will provide an extra proficiency die. This Aspect can be given to any faction, though it is currently up to the dreamdust elves who gets it.</p>

<p>In return for the economic losses the fire elves suffered, Breaker reports that the bomb caused the Crippled Barracks consequence on the Fort. The garrison at Coldwater is unusable next season, and his forces will not be able to recover from their own casualties or recruit any new units.</p>
