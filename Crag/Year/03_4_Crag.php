<h1>Spring, Year 3</h1>
<div style="overflow-x:hidden;">
    <p id="cline">ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc</p>    
</div>
<p>A sweet wind blows over the mountainside; the smell of balmblooms beginning to, well, bloom.  It was always one of your favorite times of the year as a youth; the heady scent filling Eschaton always managed to dispel many of the other more distressing smells of the city.  Curiously, this is your first time smelling it again in many years… while you don’t regret all the time you’ve spent outside of Eschaton, it is good to be reminded of what charms your birthplace did carry for you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, life is somewhat short on charms, as of late.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“You cannot be serious, Euclact.  Certainly this is some kind of long distance joke?  I wouldn’t put it past him, really.”</p>
<p>Sadly, Galfin does not look mirthful; rather, his face is one of weary and no small amount of apology.</p>
<p id="tan">“No, <b>Embebi</b>, it is no mirth, jest, or jape.  What I tell you now came true and strong from the very mouth of the greatest of our kind, the <i>Echo of Blood</i>, to be heard by all, understood by all, and obeyed by all.  While I am not worthy to question the Wisdom his orders bear, I will admit that I find no fault that you thought it first to be a jest, for it is a demand so bewildering that even I questioned that I heard it aright when first it fell upon my ears, but let there be <i>no</i> mistake; By his orders, <i>The Euclast must March</i>.”</p>
<p>You close your eyes, partially out of tiredness, but also so that you can roll them to your hearts content where Galfin cannot see them.  Ancestors Abjure, you always forget just how <i>dramatic</i> everything has to be with him.  But drama or no, it seems that his message is pretty clear… and third hell, you can’t even <i>begin</i> to list how many ways it is <i>bad</i>. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Okay, okay, understood.  You’re serious.  But… did he really give no leeway at all?  I mean… think on it, Galfin! The Euclast are the greatest of our number.  Should Eschaton be threatened, they’d be essential to seeing us through.  Not that I’d question the abilities of our fellow Aggro, but-”</p>
<p>Oh Ancestors, now he’s looking all indignant. </p>
<p id="tan">“Nor should you, Stalkact! Come, how many times must the same question be answered with different tongue? There is no exception, no recourse, the order is Ironclad; But halt, think not it unthinking of foolish! The Echo of Blood, Champion of our Ilk, made clear his reasoning the day he sent me; based on the sight of his own eyes, the hearing of his own ears, the knowledge of his own mind, he judged the rewards to be reaped by our answering this challenge to be far greater than any risk they may bear, for Attend! For more than a full tenth of a century, across one and twenty moons, it is clear more now than ever that the Eternal Foe, the Anathema, the Beast is Broken! Its threat is no more, and Eschaton now must only concern itself with quibbling neighbor kin among its threats.  To answer this Challenge is to directly address that threat! In so doing, the Euclast will score a victory a hundredfold times more telling than to continue to lay in Garrison against naught and all!”</p>
<p>It takes a moderate amount of your willpower to avoid grinding your teeth.  And not just at the mannerisms of the Euclact, Chief among the Euclast;  It both surprises you and probably shouldn’t surprise you that Echo would say as much.  You may have informed him of the dangers lurking in the mountains, Eighth hell, he even went <i>looking</i> for them… but he never saw them, and to Saltik, if he can’t see a threat, he can’t really believe it to actually <i>be</i> a threat.  Back then, you had lamented his decision to try to lay eyes or even <i>parley</i> with the… beings… who now lurk just beyond Eschaton’s borders, fearing what such a meeting might bring.  Now, you sort of regret that he didn’t.</p>
<p>Problem is, however, is that even if you did clue in Galfin on said threat (which would be a <i>horrible</i> idea, for so many reasons), he’d still probably just doggedly insist on following his orders to the letter.  You know Galfin.  He worships your sib as the hero he’s supposed to be.</p>
<p>… Cripes, again with the vitriol.  All this time cramped up in the city is really getting to you.</p>

<p>Well, nothing for it.  It’s a foregone conclusion.  You’ll just have to make do.  At least some of the new Stalkers will be able to take patrols and garrisons that the Euclast once were, but if you’re honest with yourself, even being able to match them Crag for Crag is still a fivefold decrease in protection.  The new Stalkers are Talcsome, inexperienced; even though some of their number may be Seasoned Warriors, their introductions to their new duties leaves them with few skills to fall back on.  You need more.  At least numbers might make do where skill cannot.  So, at least…</p>

<p id="Embebi">“...Very well and… true enough, Galfin.  The Euclast must march.  I may have my Stalkers to replace them where needed.  But, on said topic, perhaps there is one thing you could alter on my behalf?  There are a number of the Aggro whom I have kept an eye on, who may be suited to join the ranks of my Stalkers; as of yet, not all have agreed, but if I could ensure that certain ones I have been considering were to remain within Eschaton, then perhaps…”</p>
<p id="tan">“Alas, dear sib in arms, you ask for everything I cannot grant! For, in addition to the Euclast, our Great Paragon has decreed that an equal number of our Aggro Ranks should accompany them, to best ensure that the Challenge is successful, and the requirements I was given to choose among them was exacting! I must have those whom I will have, and I cannot, am not allowed, to waver on even a single one.  Surely, you can see the wisdom in this order?  To have more of your kind would be fitting, but to free ourselves from threat altogether, why, ever the more fitting!”</p>

<p>You stare at him.  You think your eye may have twitched.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“...Aff.  Ack.  Whatever.  Do as you have been told.”</p>
<p id="tan">“As I had always intended, Stalkact Embebi!  I go forth now, purpose aflame; by his will and word, we shall descend ere even today’s sun dip below the far horizon!  I go now into our beloved Circle, and call upon all Aggro there to answer the Call of the Greatest of our Ilk-”</p>
<p>His voice recedes into the distance as he dives into the Circle, his words for everyone to hear.  Just as soon as his voice recedes out of earshot, you drive your face into your palms, hoping to massage at least some of the tension away.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s of little use.  The simple fact is that once again, Saltik’s impetuous… you can’t even come up with a strong enough word to describe his mind right now.  You’re too frazzled.  Until now, you had felt somewhat secure in how you had handled the hidden threat surrounding Eschaton, knowing that even if they did decide to turn on you(as they inevitably would), they wouldn’t dare while the Euclast stood in fortified bastions, impenetrable no matter what numbers or ability they may possess.</p>
<p>And now, you are caught between the hard place and the other hard place.  If you continue to keep this secret, the Aggro may not be prepared for the conflict that is sure to come.  If you reveal it, however, it is <i>certain</i> that the Aggro will not be prepared for the conflict; the Named would have no choice but to engage such a hideous mockery of existence like that with everything currently available.  So, damned either way.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>...Just thinking it isn’t enough.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Crap.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Crap crap crap crap crap.  Crap! Crapcrap! Crapping, crappy, crapped on cra-”</p>
<p>“It would appear that I have come at a poor time.”</p>
<p>...shiiiiiit.</p>
<hr>
<p>The air is as sweet as the young Aggro’s language is foul.  There’s a curious wisdom to that.  </p>
<p>Stalker Actual Embebi.  She is a difficult one to meet.  Certainly, you could have arranged for it, sent an Elpahka to insist upon the meeting… but that is not the way you wanted to meet her.  No, you wanted a glimpse of her as she is true, to see her as she is when she is being her.  That is why you have had Miigra, precious Miigra, take you to this place. What you have found is only a little surprising.</p>
<p>You saw her, in your vision. One of the clearest, most certain, most unmistakable visions you have ever beheld.  It was true.  It was clear.  And it was meant for you; the voices, so many voices, so indistinct and yet also so familiar, called you by name.  <b>Ledret.</b> Your true name, not your bloodname, not your title that is what all but a few know you only as.  The name that was truly yours.  Could only be meant for you.</p>
<p>And in this visage, so clear and obvious, was a Young Crag, an Aggro.  This Crag.  It had given you pause.  Unlike the others it showed you, she is Unnamed.  Only barely titled, and that a title that had little true meaning… until, as you have heard, she wrested the meaning back from oblivion.</p>
<p>There was a reason you saw her.  A reason you witnessed her attentiveness, her concern, her edge.   You don’t know what that reason is yet.  But soon, you will find out.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“E-Esteemed Elpahka.  Your Wisdom, please… uh... forgive my crudeness.  If I had known you were coming, of course I would never have-”</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“You did not know I was coming, young Embebi, precisely because I wished to behold you in this manner.  I will not hear you apologize further for existing true.  I would not ask you to put lie to your tongue merely for the sake of sensitive old ears.”</p>
<p>You try to keep your tone strong and placid, but from the look of uncertainty, you fear you were not able to completely keep the smile from your voice.  Come now, Ledret.  There are appearances to think of.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Of… of course, Esteemed.  If your aim was to see me as I am, well, you could scarcely have picked a better time.  While it may have seemed to be in excess, if anything, I had only begun to express myself.”</p>
<p>She states it as though it is levity, but there is a solid core of truth she did not intend to part with.  Poor young Aggro.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Indeed?  Considering all you have evacuated so far, it speaks to a veritable storm of troubles, Young Embebi.  What is it that troubles you so?”</p>
<p>She hesitates, grimacing.  Her eyes flick to the Circle behind her, keenly absorbing the presence of the guards who stand watch there.  It is a swift gesture, but one that you understand immediately; some element of her troubles lie in the fact that she fears sharing them with their kin.  A complicated trial for her, indeed.  Perhaps this is why you were shown her; perhaps, if you can put her on a steady path, what she shall tread will be to the betterment of all Crag.</p>
<p>Before she can even reply, you have decided how to proceed.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Come, Embebi, Actual of the Stalkers.  Walk alongside me.  The day is lovely, and sweet smelling; I would believe that one such as you would be an ideal partner to appreciate when nature deems visit us with such a bounty.”</p>
<p>Without a word, Miigra turns, heading back toward the Pagoda, but at a serene pace.  The destination is not the objective.  It is the journey.  And as you anticipated, before long, you can hear the young elf keeping in lockstep with your companion.  You allow an opportunity to travel in tranquil silence for a while, before returning to the matter at hand.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Such a day, it seems ill fortuned that one as yourself could find such troubles as to dull its delights.  Please, Stalker Embebi.  I would hear what ails your heart.”</p>
<p>You can hear her hesitation.  Even when she speaks, you can tell you have not totally succeeded; her words are guarded, careful.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Esteemed Elpahka, I am sorry to burden you with such troubles, as they may in truth be trivials.  Err, trivial.  I am merely concerned about the commands of my… of Echo of Blood.  He has asked that the Euclast are to Descend.  The details are few, but he says there is a Challenge to attend.   If he commands it, then surely, it is necessary to some degree, but…” Her lips draw into a tight line.  “...I worry that the absence of these could leave the Crag… vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Guarded, indeed.  It is no falsehood, she is telling the truth… but not the whole of the truth.  She may be telling you a trouble… but not <i>the</i> trouble.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Vulnerable.  I see.  It is not a bad thing to be cautious, especially when it comes to the safety of Eschaton. but tell me; did I hear correctly that your own kind, the Stalkers, have swelled dramatically in number?  If I hear correctly, they may even outnumber the Euclast you concern yourself with.  Should not these numbers be more than capable of filling any position the Euclast leave vacant?  Surely, trained by your hand, they are in the finest keepings of Aggro tradition?”</p>
<p>She quirks an eyebrow at you, and you return it with an even stare.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“...I… Esteemed, if it is bravado you desire, I am afraid I am not the Echo of Blood.  While I praise my newly renewed Stalkers, they are just that- new.  Talcsome, untested.  Not without potential, but by no means the equal of those whom Echo calls. “</p>
<p>Oh <i>ho</i>. This is an interesting development.  An Aggro with some appropriate humility.  You are beginning to see why your vision led you so.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“A point wisely made, Embebi.  I can see your position was not given without due consideration to merit.  Merit I am thankful for; it seems that, in Echo’s… ‘absence’, you have taken much of the disposition and direction of the Aggro upon yourself.  Such initiative is expected of one regarded as the keenest of those who Go Forth.”</p>
<p>She looks away from you.  While her default expression seems to be that of a carefree smirk, you cannot help but notice that her features darken, a sour note on such a sweet day.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“...I do not know how much your praise is deserved, Esteemed Elpahka.  While I have done my utmost, it has come at a cost of neglecting my other duties and directives.  Everything I have done, I have done to the utmost of my ability, but even I can see where that ability has been taxed.  I do not know if what impulse I have given will be sufficient… or, upon the other side, if it was even truly worth doing.”</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“That, young Aggro, is a question that all must struggle with; indeed, one of the truest tests of character is to face that question, and yet persevere in spite of it.  It is a trial that even the greatest of our number can find… most daunting.  </p>
<p>However, such a trial does bear a question from one such as I.  If you question whether what you have done is sufficient, I would question why you believe that it may not be.  What is it you lack for?  What have you yet to accomplish?”</p>
<p>You are taking the soft route with your questions, so far.  You can tell the Young Crag is flustered enough to have received such direct attention from you; in truth, it’s a somewhat flattering experience, to inspire awe in someone like this.  You may be indulging yourself just a tad.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Aff.  Well… I know my Stalker are untested.  That can only be helped so far.  But there is an old aphorism; “Quantity is a Quality all of its own.”  I would feel more… certain, if I could but find more who were worthy of being called a Stalker, but…”</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“But?”</p>
<p>She sighs.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Forgive me Esteemed, for I am somewhat ashamed; I have already pushed the limits of propriety with my attempts to muster those worthy of the title Stalker.  I have gone far beyond mere advisement and council, and have even… persuaded… and perhaps cajoled… some of the number that I have added to my fold so far.  And yet, still, it was not enough.  Ancestors Forgive, I was intending to move even on to haranguing, in order to draw in a number of truly outstanding youths… but Echo’s orders also carry a demand for such capable youths to be brought alongside the Euclast.  I fear that by the time the Euclast Actual is finished discharging his duties, there will be precious few who could be called Stalkers among those who remain.  And without those numbers… again, I worry at our Exposure.”</p>
<p>...Concerns of propriety nonwithstanding, the concerns she bears mirror your own, though only in a microcosm.  The Youths of Eschaton dwindle.  While there was some hope that this would be supplemented by the discovery of more of your displaced kin, experience has shown that it will not be a simple matter to do so.  Already drained, and further so from their own warmaster’s orders, where could this young Aggro, driven as she is, hope to find enough souls to assuage her concerns?  In truth, there may be no correct answer to this conundrum.  Not all troubles may be solv-</p>
<p>And then, as though it were being whispered into your ear, a solution presents itself.  It is… unusual.  Unverified.  Unprecedented.  But… these times have demanded such measures before…</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Yours is a concern well spotted, and well spoken, Stalker Embebi.  Where are you to find more who are capable of being among your number?  Tell me if I speak true; I would assume those you seek would be keen of eye, hardened of body, and with a mind capable of all manner of landscraft?”</p>
<p>Ah, there’s the return of that wry smile.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Among other things, but yes, that accounts for much of it.  Indeed, the latter may be of the greatest import; there is much that can be taught or trained to make a body ready, but a mind is a much trickier thing to exercise.”</p>
<p id="Esteemed"> “Then there may be a source which has been overlooked.  Indeed, to hear such criteria, they may simply be the best possible candidates you could hope for.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">They have endured the wilds for countless years, having to learn all manner of field and craft.  They are invariably keen of senses, globally capable in hostile terrain.  They have all the mind and experience you could ask for, in perhaps all but the weaponcraft that you can so dutifully impart on them.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">I speak, of course, of the very Crag that you, yourself, rescued not but a few years ago; our wayward kin, who survived so long in the Lowlands.”</p>
<p>Her eyes furrow, confused.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Esteemed, I don’t think I understand.  We have already incorporated the Aggro of our wayward kin.  All the rest are Onagi, or Samra… or even those oddities who claim they cannot even recall what Bloodline they belong to.”</p>
<p id="Esteemed"> “Indeed, Embebi.  And so, that only leaves among their number the Onagi, Samra, or elsewise to consider.”</p>
<p>Ah, she gets it now.  Of course, though she understands, she is still uncertain. Best to elaborate.</p>
<p id="Esteemed"> “Even though they are Samra and Onagi by origin, the truth of their survival in those harsh lands, and for such great time, puts proof to their capability and endurance that any Aggro would be proud to count among their own.  From there, that experience and knowledge can be further honed by your kind.  A fitting place for those who have proved their merit.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“I… suppose I could consider them.  See if there’s any of their number that seem to have the mohs.  But, there are few youths among them… for the rest to undergo a Rite of Position, at their age… the Elpahka-”</p>
<p id="Esteemed">  “-would of course have been appraised of the wisdom of your reasoning.  It may be unorthodox, but to tell it true, Embebi, we live in Unorthodox times.  It would come to no surprise if, in time, this forthcoming would become known as the Unorthodox Generation.  Of course, they would seek to ensure that those you have encouraged to consider such a Rite are fit and truly willing to undergo such a change, but I think you will find many of their number keen for such a change.”</p>
<p>She looks at you, and the look in her eyes… it is not one of reverence, or concern; it is of <i>respect</i>.  She has heard your wisdom, and she believes it Truly Wise.</p>

<p>You have to fight back the joy welling up behind your eyes.  Your vision was truly godssent.</p>
<p>...The vision.  You have helped her, but something still seems… incomplete.  As you saw this young elf, she was vigilant, watching, but more than that… she was <i>anticipating</i>. She did not merely suspect a threat.  </p>
<p>She <i>feared</i> one.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in this moment, the time for tact has passed.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Stalker Embebi, I am glad to have assisted you, but I feel that there is something unspoken between us.”</p>
<p>Guiding gently, you bring Miigra… and by extension, your walking partner… to a halt beneath a young Balmbloom tree, one of many transplanted from carefully sheltered nurseries into the new gardens intended for your Bloodline, the Elpahka, to meditate and seek clarity.  No traffic surrounds you, in this serene place; you are as alone as you could possibly be within Eschaton’s walls.  You inhale the heady scent deeply.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Stalker Embebi, What is it that you fear?”</p>
<p>She stiffens.  The question is carefully chosen, a selection from an old Aggro Wisdom.  </p>
<p><i>If you wish to appraise your enemy/ see what they are/</i></p>
<p><i>If you wish to fight your enemy/ watch what they do/</i></p>
<p><i>If you wish to be your enemy/ ask what they cherish/</i></p>
<p><i>If you wish to know your enemy/ know what they fear/</i></p>
<p><i>If you have done all to your enemy/ then you will hold your enemy in both hands.</i></p>
<p>Some of the deeper parts of this wisdom… elude you, but the Wisdom on Fear can ring true even for an Elpahka.  If you wish to understand someone, know what motivates them and why they act the way they do, you must know what it is that drives them… what it is that they fear.</p>
<p>You can see the young Aggro struggle with herself… until, finally, a serene look passes over her face.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Esteemed Elpahka… what I tell you… I beg you, please, forgive me what I have done, and tell me, what must I do.</p>
<p id="Embebi">I fear an enemy prowls outside the walls of Eschaton.  It is quick, and cunning, but far more than that, it is <i>twisted</i>.  It speaks words of acceptance, says it wishes to know us, to be us… but what it is is revolting, a vision of depravity and madness… a visage of the <span class="animal">Animals. </span>  But they are not them.  They are somehow worse.</p>
<p id="Embebi">They seek to become them.  And they claim our Ancestors gave them the idea.</p>
<p id="Embebi">I confronted them, knew of them, and to my shame, allowed them to have pity on me.  But since then, I have concealed my knowledge of them, because… what I truly fear… is that their claims of strength may be <i>true.</i>  </p>
<p id="Embebi">The Aggro have lost much, and gained little.  I fear that if I spoke of this foe, it would force us to do what Aggro must do; to fight, to kill, to die… and, perhaps, to lose.  I fear we are not prepared to fight this foe.  Not yet.  And so, I have done all I can to try and prepare us.  But now I fear that the secrets I have kept may harm us, for if they come, none will know what they are, what to expect… and even I know scarcely more than nothing.</p>
<p id="Embebi">I have carried this weight for so long, Esteemed.  I have applied all my Wisdom to it.  But it is clear to me now that I should have sought those of greater wisdom in the first place.  So please, tell me; what should I have done?  What should I do?”</p>
<p>Her words take on a pleading tone.  It is somewhat shocking, to see this strong Aggro warrior riven so.  You had marveled at her lack of hubris, but now you truly understand why; there is no room for bravado when you fear the fate of your kind rests on your shoulders.  You know that concern intimately.</p>
<p>And yet, to hear of her tale… to see her decisions… what she should have done is obvious.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Stalker Embebi,  I have heard your tale.  I see your concern.  You were wise to consult me on this, for if there is one advantage to an age such as mine, it is the advantage to have seen and heard so much that many paths, once occluded, have already been traveled, well worn.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">And so I tell you now, young Embebi; what you should have done… is exactly what you did.”</p>
<p>She is surprised.  You would have been, too, at that age, to hear such words from an elder.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Your concerns were wise, valid.  It hurts to keep secrets so, but you knew the truth of it; your people must be ready, and while secrets may kill, they pale compared to truths which <i>will</i>.  You are forced to trust the fates, and every day you must do so, you will feel a great weight, for whatever the fates decide, it will have been your fault.  You will bear the responsibility, whether it bore good or ill… and for whatever good it may bring, it is the ill you will feel all the more keenly.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">It is a difficult trial you must endure, Embebi.”</p>
<p>Gently, slowly, you place your hand upon her arm.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Know that you bear it as well as any I have known.”</p>
<p>Both of you are silent for a long period.  You allow your palm to remain where it is; even laid flat, you can feel the strength of her young frame.  You wonder what it would have been like, to be strong, like that.  You wonder what she is feeling from you.  Her face betrays nothing; her eyes are closed.  Placid.</p>
<p>Finally, they shoot open.  There is a new expression there.  <i>Determination.</i></p>
<p id="Embebi">“Thank you, Esteemed.  I… You have... Thank you.”</p>
<p>Her eyes swing back to The Circle, not terribly far; though it seemed quite long, your walk was measured in mere minutes.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“I must see to my recruits.  Fare well, Esteemed Elpahka.  I will keep your people safe.”</p>
<p>It takes her mere seconds for her long gait to carry her from the small garden and back onto the street, steaming for her destination.  Alone in the garden, you allow yourself a moment of softness… a moment to allow the joy from behind your eyes.  It would be difficult to explain.</p>

<p>You allow the moment to pass.  There is still more to be achieved today.  You rouse Miigra to move, continuing toward the Pagoda.  However, before you can even reach the steps, a familiar voice graces your ears.  </p>

<p id="Slabal">“Ah.  Ledret.  ...Are you well?  Your eyes appear watery.”</p>
<p>...Whoops.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Esteemed waves a hand, dismissively. </p>
<p id="Esteemed">“It is nothing to be concerned with, <b>Slabal</b>.  Merely a brief consequence of leaving my high perch.  It will not trouble me long.” </p>
<p>She returns her hand to resting on her lap, as it usually does.  She does not even bother to wipe away the moisture.  You aren’t sure why not, but it is likely something to do with appearances.  She has often confided in you that concerns for such frequently trouble her.  This, at least, you can somewhat understand.  It is important to set a proper example.  You aren’t sure if not clearing moisture is really proper, however.  Oh well.  Best not to dwell on it.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“It is gratifying to hear it is of little consequence.  Furthermore, it is fortunate that I have encountered you here.  It will save me some time, as I had intended to speak with you on an imminent matter.”</p>

<p>She looks into your eyes, a faintly curious expression on her face.  You notice that said eyes appear to be clear, sharp, and free from cloudiness.  This, too, is fortunate.  It indicates that she will likely be in a more positive mood.  That may help, considering the matter at hand.</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“It appears that it is my fate to be of use to many young Crag this day, Slabal.  Come, let me not keep you from your next destination; I have no doubt that you have some manner of business you are intent upon. I will tread beside you, and hear what you have to say.”</p>

<p>Hmm.  Well, your next business <i>was</i> going to see her.  But if she’s willing to save you a trip up and down those steps (fortunately, that loose flagstone was repaired, but you are still confident that more can be done to repair it, if only time allowed), then you see no reason to object.  Lets see, next would be… ah, yes.</p>
<p>Your feet turn, working automatically to carry you toward the Ambon Aeternal, it’s newly carved stones dominating a good portion of the Eschaton skyline.  Although not (yet) towering over the buildings surrounding it, the footprint negotiated for the structure did turn out far wider and, frankly, squat than you had earlier envisioned; you figure it will take many weeks of checking and testing to ensure that the construction is, indeed, as fully sound as the Scholars insisted it would be.</p>

<p>But yes, your question.  Best to just get to it directly; The Esteemed has put her steed in lockstep beside you, allowing you to look at her as you speak… important, as you will need to gauge her reaction carefully.  This will likely be difficult for you, but you must endeavor nonetheless.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“I thank you for hearing me, Ledret.  I must admit, what I wish to speak on is something I have intended for some time, yet it did not seem an imminent issue until recently.  Now, with the appropriate time to act upon it looming closer, I find myself growing more concerned that it may be… ill-planned.  I am hoping that you can provide some consult in this matter.”</p>

<p>Her lips quirk.  </p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Dear Slabal, I would hope by now that if there is one thing you have proven, time and time again, it is that your plans are rarely ill.  Still, I will hear your concern.  What is it that troubles you?”</p>

<p id="Slabal">“It concerns Eparchy.”</p>

<p>The quirk in her lips threatens to become a full smile.  This is encouraging.  </p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Ah, our blossoming industrial outpost.  I am led to understand that the yields it has produced are far outstripping expectations… or, at least, established precedent, as I have no doubt you anticipated, and indeed had a significant hand in allowing, such a bountiful harvest of metals.”</p>

<p> The wealth of Eparchy’s veins was actually a surprise to you as well… it seemed the Bakshish who documented the site’s wealth did not exaggerate as much as you had suspected.  You should probably thank the First for that, when you go to speak to him later.  </p>

<p id="Slabal">“Indeed.  In truth, it is that wealth that has advanced our timetable somewhat.  The amount currently produced well exceeds our promised tribute to the Swords, and now much of the material lays fallow.  This is of little concern, but as it gives me opportunity to advance my plans ahead of schedule, I can see little reason to delay… although, perhaps, that may be where wisdom lies.</p>
<p>Ledret, I have not confided this yet, but I had planned for Eparchy to become more than just a mining outpost.  Indeed, it’s position above the Stream of Consciousness, and it’s proximity to areas that have already been visited by Lo- Otherelves gives allows it to function in a much more important capacity.”</p>
<p>Ledret says nothing, but the quirk of her lips has decidedly abandoned the potential smile.  Oh well.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“As you have mentioned in the past, Ledret, it is simply a matter of time before Otherelf curiosities lead them to seek out our home.  Even having traveled among them… or perhaps, because of that… even I still find such an outcome to be… disturbing.  Nowhere was that made more clear than with the incident we narrowly avoided with the Rivers.  Thus, my reasoning is as so: if we are likely to have Otherelf visitors regardless, why not act proactively in that regard?</p>
<p>In summary, it is my intention to form Eparchy into a… a lure, of sorts.  A place intended, and designed, for the Otherelves to come into, and perhaps even remain inside of for a time.  By openly providing such a place, we will quell curiosities, allowing us more time before they identify our true home.  In addition, the new bounty of Eparchy will allow us to offer further enticement, as we can provide goods, both raw, refined, and crafted, so as to keep their attention focused entirely there.  </p>
<p>However, my concern is this; I had intended for this to occur some time within the next several decades, after the Otherelves had already become somewhat settled with the conclusion of the conflict.  I had believed it would take that long for Eparchy to become sufficiently bountiful as to support my plans.  I have not fully considered the consequences of acting more swiftly… but as far, I can see no threat to doing so.  Can you, Ledret?”</p>

<p>You use all of your powers of observation to attempt to parse the expression on Ledret’s face.  Unfortunately, as you feared she might, she has adopted her completely placid look; all that you can tell from that is that she is feeling <i>something</i>, and yet does not wish to show it.  Again, appearances.  This circumstance is wholly frustrating.</p>

<p>You pass much of your journey in silence.  The longer Ledret remains silent and placid, the more concerned you become that there is some fundamental flaw you have overlooked.  Unfortunately, if you did not spot it before, you do not believe you will spot it now.  Instead, you review your mental checklist of measurements and stress tests you will need to put the squat structure ahead through today.  Perhaps now is the time to see if the foundation has fully settl-</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“Slabal, even though I can understand the some of reasons you did not consult me on this sooner- after all, you did not believe it to be quite so imminent a concern- I would dearly hope that one of those reasons would not be that you feared my response.  Even though I am thankful for the casual tone our conversations have adopted, let there be no doubt in your mind that, while I cherish you as Slabal, so too do I recognize you by full entitlement.  You are the Layer of the Path, the greatest and most wise of the Onagi, and nothing you have done has ever shaken my belief that you deserve that title more than any other.  If you believe that this is the Path that Eparchy should take, then you must believe in that belief.  You must believe in your judgement.  And if you find yourself flagging, then by all means, you may believe in my belief in your judgement.  I do not believe that it will ever steer you wrong.”</p>

<p>It takes you a while to parse all the nested beliefs in Ledret’s response.  You think she’s saying she approves?</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“With that being said, I must admit that the prospect you present does concern me… not in its wisdom, but rather its unknowns.  The accounts I have heard of the Lowland- the Otherelves is… mixed.  In truth, I cannot even truly expound upon the wisdom of attracting them so close to Eschaton, for there is so much unknown about them.</p>
<p>...But, the Unknown is what seems to define our times.  And I <i>believe</i> the time for being wary of the Unknown, simply because it is Unknown, is passed.  By all means, Slabal, I encourage you along this path.  I am eager to hear what the results may be.”</p>

<p>Well.  You honestly didn’t anticipate a response that positive.  The Esteemed has seemed to be in better spirits overall for the last several weeks, however.  Perhaps whatever was settling heavily upon her has truly lifted.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that wholehearted acceptance has only made you more uncertain about the wisdom of this plan.  For all the wisdom you know that the Esteemed possesses, you know that she can become… overly optimistic seems a good way to put it.  However, in spite of this, you can see little logic in arresting your plans for Eparchy just because the Esteemed is in good cheer about it.  Very well.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Very well.  I thank you for your wisdom, Ledret.  I will send word to my team in Eparchy to begin making the arrangements.  There is still much to be done within Eschaton’s walls first, but it will be better to get the stone rolling.”</p>

<p id="Esteemed">“I am glad that I could be of such assistance to you, Slabal.  However, I am afraid that the day grows long, and in spite of its loveliness, I must return to my Pagoda.  Will you be able to accompany me for brew, later?”</p>

<p>No.  There is entirely too much to do.  It surprises you somewhat that she would not intuit that.  Although maybe she did, and is just merely maintaining that she intends to continue seeking such rituals.  Status quo is important to seek, in some cases.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“No, Ledret.  There is entirely too much to do.  Perhaps time will become available at a later date.  I will attempt to keep that in mind.”</p>

<p>The Esteemed says nothing more.  She simply moves her hand in an accepting gesture, and then her ox turns about-face and begins plodding toward the Pagoda.  </p>
<p>Well, that was overall gratifying.  Especially to get that task completed so promptly.  Now, if you can attend to the tests-</p>

<p id="First">“Layer of the Path! How fortuitous it is I should encounter you here!”</p>

<p>-Ah.  </p>
<hr>
<p>Well, it seems that happenstance is willing to grant you some measure of reward for being out and about in this stench.  It has been extraordinarily difficult finding time to speak with the Layer, even with her workers toiling away at constructing the massive Monument to Compromise that looms behind you.  Of course, it is simply a consequence of her dutiful nature, and your own complimentary dutiful nature, that has kept the two of you apart for so long.  </p>

<p id="Slabal">“<b>First Among Scholars</b>.  I trust that this day finds you well.”</p>

<p>And there, of course, is yet another one of her many admirable natures, that she can endure the stink in the air with such grace.  However, thinking of said natures, her body language makes it clear that she was en route to somewhere… likely, the depressing result of the Elpahka’s interference.  But despite your feelings on it, you have no intention of coming off as some kind of impeding gadfly.  You have no doubt she has to put up with more than enough of that already.</p>

<p id="First">“Oh, well enough, well enough.  Of course, don’t let me stop you, I’m sure you have a great deal to do, as we all do of course.  Tell me, where were you headed?”</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Ah.  Toward the Ambon, actually.  There are still some tests that I want to run on its stability.”</p>

<p id="First">“Oh, then it seems we have the same destination!”</p>
<p>, you glibly lie. </p>
<p id="First">“Come, we’ll go together.  It’ll give us an opportunity to catch up; after all, we’ve both had our noses so close to the lectern that we’ve barely seen a hair of eachother.  And in spite of the delightful work you did on the behalf of my scholars!  I can’t imagine it was easy, managing so many different demands, but I must say that the final result exceeded everyone’s expectations!”</p>

<p>This is not technically a lie, as you were certain the entire thing would come crashing down within days.  It is little surprise to you that she seems equally concerned with it’s integrity.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Working with the specifications given was… challenging.  It is gratifying to hear that the result was acceptable.”</p>

<p>Ah, that deadpan humor of hers.  You forgot how much you missed it. Still, you’ll bite.</p>
<p id="First">“Oh, more than just acceptable.  Indeed, I understand that even now several of the Heads are working day and night to fill its halls with every scrap of understanding they have recovered, rediscovered, and recalled… although, of course, the latter of these does need to undergo <i>significant</i> peer review.  My reason for heading this way, actually.”</p>
<p>As if.  You have far better things to do than double check what is doubtlessly information garbled beyond the point of usefulness.  But that does remind you, it’d be a fitting task for Drivel once he returns from his outing to Eparchy.  </p>

<p id="Slabal">“I appreciate the trust that they place in our handiwork.  I will note, for all the difficulties the… combined requirements afforded, there were many of the requirements that, taken individually, were quite intriguing.  Indeed, I had actually hoped to speak to you on that.”</p>

<p id="First">“Oh?  My apologies if I’ve been difficult to find, there is always so much to do that I often forget to make time to be available…” </p>
<p>Available and presentable, you mean.  As much as you’ve come to rely on your tinctures, they can leave you in a somewhat… disheveled and manic state.  That’s why one of your many locks is now designed to require patience to open.  It has been essential in preventing further… incidents.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Your apology is unnecessary.  It was I who had difficulties making the time.  In specific, I was hoping that some of your Heads could provide me and the other Onagi with some of their lores regarding certain theoretical building practices.  I am aware that some of our number became quite enamored with the concepts presented, although I will admit some of them seemed outlandish to me.  Still, there would be no more appropriate time to attempt to put theory into practice.”</p>

<p>Pragmatic as ever!  </p>
<p id="First">“Of course! I’ll make a priority of it.  I’m fairly certain I know of those Heads of whom you speak.  I’ll ensure that they have presentations prepared for your builders as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>At least, the ones who you have any shred of respect for.  Dedication to practical experimentation or no, you would be remiss if one of your thickheaded scholars ended up providing some schlock that caused a building to collapse on the Layer… you find yourself unable to even consider the scenario for long.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“I would appreciate that.  We are beginning the preliminary outlines for the next stage of renovation, and having the input as soon as possible would be of great service.  And while speaking on great services, I must also express my gratitude for the work done in sighting the location of Eparchy.  It appears that the bounty of the veins there are beyond even our most optimistic predictions.”</p>

<p>A hot lance of pride shoots through your heart and mind.  You have to fight to keep a wicked grin off your face, and even so, you’re pretty sure you’re still smirking.  But hells, you deserve it! The shouting matches you had with those imbeciles who refused to recognize the tell-tale signs of oxidized hematite nearly made you hoarse.  They were even the ones who insisted that you lowball your estimates… hearing that you should have ignored them entirely is the best news you’ve heard all month.</p>

<p id="First">“Ah, it warms my heart to hear that I, ehem, of course, <i>we</i> Bakshish could be of such assistance to the noble Onagi.  And if that find gratifies you, I actually have more delightful news; after conclusively reviewing the results, we have determined that our expedition yielded another incredible find!”</p>
<p>She raises an eyebrow, ever unflappable.  Amazing.  Such composure.</p>
< id="First"p>“It would seem that, to our north, a crater exists that is lined with a mysterious, difficult to understand substance that the ancient learnings have dubbed ‘noqual’... likely for it’s curious lack of any magical qualities!  Rather than just being arcanically neutral- as is, say, iron, or common stone- this substance actually absorbs, traps, and <i>dismisses</i> arcanic energies.  The applications of such a substance on that merit alone are innumerable… and that is without mentioning its unique combination of malleability, hardness, and density.  Light, but as workable as iron, it could be a fantastic substance for Eschaton’s industrial use!”</p>
<p>The eyebrow lowers, and a distant look crosses her face.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Interesting.  Such a substance would have numerous possible applications.  But given how long it has taken to understand this substance, I would assume that it is difficult to isolate and obtain?”</p>
<p>You twirl your hand dismissively.</p>
<p id="First">“Oh, nothing of the sort, especially now! Indeed, the only delay was in taking every pain to ensure that the substance was fully understood; after all, while we do have some knowledge and texts to fall back on, there is no sense in bringing a partially understood substance within Eschaton’s walls without due dilligence!”</p>
<p>Of course, you actually understood the full nature of the substance within weeks of recovering the sample.  You merely sat on the discovery, as you wondered if there was any way you could use it to your specific ends… after all, it is quite potent.  However, ensuring that the lode ends up predominately in the hands of the Onagi seems an acceptable alternative… after all, it quickly became clear that although you understood it completely, you lacked the means or amount of the substance to do anything of note with it.</p>

<p>Also, you might have forgot about it under all the other research.  But no one needs to know that.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“Your dedication to the safety of the people of Eschaton is wise, First.  If you can provide details on the location of this deposit, I will see if I can make arrangements to have it analyzed; if of sufficient quantity, we may even have need of another Outpost.  I will admit, that is an enticing prospect.” She gets a far away look, but before you can brag about your find any further, she continues.  “With speaking of deposits and outposts, I recall another thing I wanted to confer with you about, First.  The Otherelf Feather.”</p>

<p>The heady sensation of pride is dimmed somewhat by this question, replaced by a guilty wariness.</p>
<p id="First">“Um… what of it?”</p>

<p id="Slabal">“I would like to request its use, if it could be made available.”</p>
<p>Aw, shit.  You were afraid she’d ask that.</p>
<p>Your mind flashes back all the messages you have sent… and still intend to send… to your Lowlander Informant.  And, far worse, all the responses.  You’ve found that, with proper coaxing, the Feather is capable of ‘recovering’ messages previously stored upon it.  Now, so far, all the messages you’ve recovered were those directed either to all, or to yourself, so it may be that one cannot access a message not intended for them… but your confidence in that theory is hardly ironclad.  After all, your particular feather hasn’t received anything but messages sent to yourself or multiple recipients.  </p>
<p>If the Layer were to hear some of those answers you received… or might even intercept one of the Latest answers you’ve been getting, as your research- ahem- <i>intensifies…</i></p>
<p>Thoughts of pride gone, you make a conscious effort not to clamp your teeth together.  As calmly, and casually as you can manage, you respond.</p>
<p id="First">“Uh… well, about that… it <i>is</i> currently undergoing a wide battery of tests that have occupied its use for a while, and might, possibly, prevent its use for a while more… out of curiosity, what do you need it for?”</p>
<p>She hesitates, mulling over her answer, and with each passing moment, you cannot shake the suspicion that she suspects.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“I suppose at this stage there is little sense in concealing the matter.  I am currently pursuing plans to make Eparchy into a multipurpose Otherelf mercantile and isolation location.  The bounty of iron found there means that we should be able, in addition to providing raw materials, of providing crafted goods in order to keep Otherelf attention focused on Eparchy, allowing Eschaton to go undiscovered longer.  I would hope to use the feather to ask the Otherelves’ Wisdoms what goods are desirable, so as to maximize attention.”</p>
<p>A tidal wave of emotional responses to this new knowledge washes over you, but in this moment, you decide to cling to Relief, as her response gives you an out for your current predicament.</p>
<p id="First">“Ah! Well, in that case, of course, I can do far better than a mere 25 word question! After all, very soon, the Lowlander- err, Otherelves, you’re calling them?  Well, they will be having their Annual collective celebration, and I had intended to be in attendance once more! I can bring your question directly to the ‘dignitaries’, and be able to provide detailed lists of goods that they require, desire, and seek to acquire! Indeed, I had intended to go and speak with the Head of the Aggro Stalkers, Embebi, about our plan to reach a distant place known as ‘Oarsman’s Rest’.  Unless I miss my guess, some <i>river travel</i> may even be required.”</p>
<p>You try, but don’t entirely succeed, at keeping the excitement out of your voice.  In truth, ever since you learned of the name, and verified its coordinates with your Informant, you’ve been somewhat giddy at the prospect of delving into the ancient practice of aquaportation.  You’ve absorbed every scrap of knowledge available about it, and the practice seems utterly <i>fascinating</i>.  Sliding across water on large, wooden sleds, friction all but ignored thanks to water’s slick nature?  You can only hope to convince your guide that such a practice will be necessary to make good time.</p>

<p id="Slabal">“That would be an acceptable alternative.  I would promise to provide you with information regarding Eparchy’s output and our industrial options, but I suspect you know it just as well as I do.”</p>
<p><i>Phew</i>. Boulder dodged.</p>

<p id="First">“Oh, of course.  Regardless, I will take pains to refresh myself and bring only the most recent projections and possibilities along with me.  In fact… the prospect is so intriguing, I think I may postpone my reviews for now, and see exactly how much Stalker Embebi believes we can bring on our journey; some samples of our fine product would not go amiss.” </p>
<p>And, of course, that was what you were heading to do earlier anyway... </p>

<p id="Slabal">“That would be wise.  I have spoken with Stalker Embebi somewhat recently.  It is my understanding that her duties have become somewhat more extensive, so it would be best to ensure her availability.”</p>

<p>You sweep your hand in acknowledgement, but a self assured smile sprouts on your face.  “Oh, I’m certain she’ll be able to make time for this.  In fact, I’m certain that she relishes the prospect.”</p>

<p>---</p>


<p id="Embebi">“I absolutely cannot make time for that.  I can’t even entertain the prospect.” </p>
<p>Your teeth squeak as you clench them.  </p>
<p id="First">“I <i>see</i>.  And pray, may I ask why this <i>essential voyage</i> comes at such a low priority to you?”</p>
<p>Rather than defiant, her expression is one of weariness.  Uncharacteristically, you somewhat regret the cutting nature of your question.  Still, you make your displeasure obvious in your expression.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“To tell it in full debrief, First Among Scholars, it is not so much a matter of priorities as necessities.  With Sal- Echo’s extended… foray, into the lowlands, a great deal of the responsibilities he would normally shoulder have fallen upon me.  I bear them dutifully, o’course, but the simple fact is that they occupy the full of my time.  I’m sorry for the inconvenience this causes.” </p>

<p><i>Inconvenience</i> is a rather underwhelming way of putting it!  Of course, you cannot help but feel a little chagrined at having misdirected your anger; <i>Of course</i>, the root of the problem is not Embebi, but rather, that <i>Oaf</i>.  Amazing how even when he’s <i>gone</i>, he can still find ways to make your life intolerable!  </p>

<p id="First">“Ah.  That would explain your reticence.  Well, I suppose it can’t be helped.  I must admit, I find it somewhat surprising that his duties would fall upon you.  Do you not have other, more senior Aggro to whom the task should fall? ”</p>

<p>She sighs.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Unfortunately, no.  While there are Aggro who are more ‘senior’, speaking agelike, nearly all of them are Senret; their job now is to advise and to tutor, not to issue command.  And as for senior, the way you’re probably thinking of it,” 
<p>she shrugs, </p>
<p id="Embebi">“as Stalker Actual, well, in absentia of Echo and the Euclast Actual, I’m pretty much all there is, for better or worse.”</p>

<p>You close your eyes, then massage your temples with your fingertips.  Of course, it was going to be something like that.  In spite of all of your vast knowledge, it can still surprise you how many of the other Bloodlines hamper themselves with such restrictive concepts of Seniority.  The fact that a genius mind, such as yourself, could achieve so high a Title in spite of the ‘traditional’ type of Bakshish that it would fall upon is just evidence of the Bakshish’ logical supremacy.  But now is not the time for Blood contests.</p>

<p id="First">“Very well.  I understand.  Your experience and skill will be sorely missed, but I suppose I will need to make do with one of your subordinates.  I am certain that they should be up for the simple task of guiding me.  Tell me,  how soon can you have one of your number available?  I would like to confer on options for our travel…”</p>
<p>...her plump lips draw into a tight line.  Ah.  You can already feel your blood begin to heat.</p>

<p id="Embebi">“First Among Scholars, I know you’re eager to continue your Lowlander Studies, but the simple fact is that I will <i>not</i> be sending any further Stalkers forth.   It is not only the Euclast Actual that is to be away, but in fact, the whole host of the Euclast.  Orders have been given.  And in their absence, I cannot afford the loss of even a single Stalker to Eschaton’s defense.  Once the host has departed, not one more Aggro, Stalker or otherwise, will leave Eschaton under my command until we see their return.  I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Words escape you, although frustrated little screams do not.  Your teeth clench as you feel your ire rekindling once more.</p>

<p id="First">“And so that’s it, I suppose?  Because Echo’s impulsive demands have ordered it, Eschaton is to be left bereft of defenders, and I must sacrifice a great opportunity to further our understanding? Is that what you’re telling me, that he has managed to <i>accidentally</i> thwart not only the progress of the Crag, but seeks in one swoop to endanger them as well?  Is this to be believed, that such orders could be considered consciable, or even <i>sane</i>, especially considering the thick head of the one who issued them?!”</p>

<p>As soon as the last words leave your mouth, you find cause to regret them, as you feel a hand fall heavily on your shoulder.  Suddenly, keenly aware of your position, you cast your eyes about, seeing and <i>feeling</i> the stares of the Aggro guards around you.  Curiously, this does not cause your ire to recede; if anything, you can feel it more the keenly at the thought of being threatened with violence simply for speaking the obvious truth!</p>
<p>However, as your gaze tracks back up to Embebi’s face, you do see something that cools you somewhat; namely, rather than anger or disgust, it is that wry smile that rests upon her face; faintly bemused, but from your time travelling together, you can tell there is no condescension behind it. </p>

<p id="Embebi">“Direct as ever, First Among Scholars.  It’s charming to see that there is little that will dull your tongue; not many of your kind would be so bold.“ </p>
<p>She looks to the other Aggro, and with a flick of her eyes, they return to their prior business.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“To be fair, your concerns do not go, heh, ‘Un-echoed’, by some of our number.  It’s a difficult position we are in, but we all must simply trust that there is a Wisdom we do not fully comprehend, quiaff?” </p>
<p>Somehow, her smile actually intensifies, as it appears something occurred to her. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Tell you true, First, as it occurs to me, there <i>is</i> a way I can think to get you to your Lowlander Celebration on time.  I trust you happen to recall when you and yours accompanied the Aggro as we scouted out the mountainsides, quiaff?”</p>
<p>You have a bad feeling about the direction this conversation is taking.</p>
<p id="First">“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“So, in spite of your bloodline, you’ve proven with fair repetition that you can rough along as well as any Aggro can, quiaff?”</p>
<p>You sniff, indignantly.  </p>
<p id="First">“I wouldn’t expect that you’d need to ask that.  As I recall, you yourself have seen how I can handle myself in unfamiliar terrain.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“All well and good! So, obvious solution; you can just go <i>with</i> the Euclast into the Lowlands.  Wherever they’re going, I’m sure that it’ll be a simple matter to get to your celebration once down there; plenty of those Lowlanders seem friendly sorts, like as much to give you a trail to follow alongside.”</p>
<p>A chill runs through your stomach, and a sick feeling settles in your spine.   “...Are you suggesting that I <i>march</i>? With an Aggro War Column?  Heading towards even-ancestors-don’t-know-where?”</p>
<p>She shrugs, flippantly. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Truth told, it’s either that, or you try to find your own way, First.  I might like you, but my Word is solid as granite; Every remaining Aggro will have one and only task, and that is to protect Eschaton.  No matter how you reason or cajole, I will not bend on this.  That said, given your determination?  I’d actually give you even odds if you just decided to point yourself towards your destination, and ancestors help whatever beasts or Lowlanders got in your way.”</p>
<p>You feel like you should be far more furious at her being so casual about your iron will, but for some reason, you can’t help but feel a little disarmed.  Truth is, upon consideration… the prospect of travelling once more with the Aggro is not <i>entirely</i> appalling.  After all, hard as it may have been, the endeavor was not entirely exhausting; you may be Bakshish, but the gifts of the Path are present even within your scholarly bloodline.  And Embebi’s logic, though you hesitate (but only a little) to call it that, is sound;  Eschaton <i>must</i> be defended, and if you <i>must</i> get to the potluck, then the only sensible option is to go with the reason that Eschaton has to be concerned with defense.  </p>
<p>It takes you scant seconds to decide.  Very well.  You’ve endured far worse for your studies.</p>
<p id="First">“Very well, Embebi.  You speak sensibly.  I will make preparations.  When do the Euclast leave Eschaton?”</p>
<p>She rolls her hand.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Oh, in a few… hours.”</p>
<p>… <i>Fresh Hells.</i> </p>
<p id="First"><i>“Hours?!”</i></p>
<p id="Embebi"> “Aff, hours.  Plans as is that they’ll be leaving afore sunset.  Probably march through the night on first day.”</p>
<p id="First">“B-But… the preparations! The Samples I need, the documentation, the papers!”</p>
<p id="Embebi"> “Well, sounds as to me that you need to get on that directly.  Not much time to be standing here complaining, quiaff?”</p>
<p>You can feel your eyeball begin to twitch, but you master yourself.  She’s not wrong, after all. You make an attempt at unclenching your teeth, but only partially succeed there.</p>
<p id="First">“<i>Wisely Stated, Stalker Embebi.  There is no time to tarry.</i>”</p>
<p>Last word achieved, you rush from the Circle, making a arrowline towards your office.  Irritable as you are, as you check the list of preparations you must make off in your head, you feel certain that there is enough time for everything, if you can avoid getting sidetracked (i.e. don’t let anyone else get a word in edgewise).    The only concern is in acquiring a pack animal in time… although, certainly the Aggro will let you use one of theirs if necessary.  But if not… if they are being that petulant about your presence, which you wouldn’t put past them… then you can shoulder the burden your own damn self.  After all, how hard could it be?</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>...Huh.  Not really all that hard, actually.  You were sort of suspecting a dramatic irony of sorts, there.  Is it ironic that it wasn’t ironic?</p>
<p>You shake your head.  While the travel has not been too exhausting, it is circular thoughts like that that make you worry about what weeks of exposure to the Lowland might do to your health.  </p>
<p>Fortunately for your other health concerns, it seems the Aggro have had little interest in harrassing you… although that may be helped somewhat by your travelling ‘Companion’, with who you struck a rapport early in the march.  Unsurprisingly, he’s another one of Embebi’s Stalkers, whom you are beginning to suspect may be the most reasonable and cunning of all the Aggro.  He’s known as… it’s either Gustaf, or Guztav, or some variation on that, you aren’t sure; the man pronounces his own name so slopilly that you can hardly tell, and it doesn’t help matters that the other Aggro just refer to him as ‘Goose’.  Still, speech oddities aside, his company has been… tolerable.</p>

<p>As you pack up your breakfast remains (more ryecrackers, oh boy), you spot an odd movement; the march has already begun, but for some reason, at a steeply acute angle to what it was before.  Finding your relative position in the column(near the rear, but not the absolute back; you have no intention being caught in an ambush from behind), you sidle up alongside Gustaf(?)</p>

<p id="First">“What’s going on?  Were we off course again?”</p>
<p id="Gustaf">“Yes and no.  Not off course.  Just setting a new one.”</p>
<p>His soft-tongued drawl oozes out of his mouth.  Soft and calm, it is one of the frustrating parts of your talks, as you can never coax him to speak any faster than he means to, and he always means to give every syllable it’s due honor.  You can’t even <i>begin</i> to imagine why some of the Aggro say you sound <i>alike.</i></p>
<p id="First">“...as informative as ever.  Elaborate, you layabout!”</p>
<p>He smugs.  His face is constantly smugging.  You’re somewhat envious of how naturally he does it.</p>
<p id="Gustaf">“Orders from ahead, of course.  A change in direction.  We’re going someplace new.”</p>
<p>You frown. On that expression, at least, you have him beat. </p>
<p id="First">“Orders? Whose orders?”</p>
<p id="Gustaf">“Who else?  The Paragon himself.  Echo of Blood.”</p>
<p> You feel the blood drain from your face.   </p>
<p id="First"> “Echo?! Echo is here?”</p>
<p>He says nothing, merely waving his hand in the affirmative.</p>
<p id="First">“But… But I thought we were going to <i>him</i>.  Where is he sending us now?  Where are we going?”</p>
<p>At this, his smug smile blossoms into a toothy grin.</p>
<p id="Gustaf">“Ah, where else would he send the Aggro, First?  The answer is obvious.</p>
<p id="Gustaf">We’re going to <i>kill</i>.”</p>
<p>A Warm wind blows across the Lowlands.  It promises Blood.</p>

<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic:</b>  <i>The project to renew Eschaton has demanded much of the Onagi people.  Beginning with the soul-crushing decision to fully abandon what was once held dear, and then continuing, day in and day out, a non-stop flurry of construction in order to give the people of Eschaton what they need.  And yet, in all this, one of Eschaton’s people, the Onagi themselves, have selflessly gone unrewarded for their efforts.  Now, with all of the other Bloodlines seen to, the Layer attends to her penultimate plans, the most difficult plans of all; a lack of plans.</i></p>
<p><i>Throughout the reconstruction efforts, the Onagi have been kept to task, motivated by peer and need to attend only to what was required.  Along the way, one of the great callings of all craftselves, Beauty, was subsumed; What could be was all too often displaced by what must be. Now, it is the time to return to that hallowed task.  For this stage, The Layer of the Path has reserved for herself the duties of seeing to the practical matters of the Onagi; smithies, masons, kilns, and the other assorted elements by which they ply the skills of their bloodline.  To all other Onagi, she has but one stoneclad mandate: Create. </i></p>
<p><i>It is not enough that Eschaton merely is.  To recover, Eschaton must once more Be. And it is only by placing her… faith, in the skills of those who revere her that Eschaton could hope to recover such a vital element.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Infrastructure(Enrichment)</b> Skill to replace the aspect Cast the Fourth Stone: Esteem with the aspect Cast the Fifth Stone: Actualization.  The individual skills and interests of the Onagi craftselves are placed upon display, and a bounty of beauty (and, in some cases, ugly) springs forth.  Aiding in this explosion of individual creation is the Lore of the Bakshish scholars; Bearing architectural and industrial concepts ranging from ancient to untested, they give ample fodder for thought to the craftselves who yearn to do more than mearly construct; they yearn to Create.  This aid allows Slabal to Invoke the aspect  Cast the Fourth Stone: Esteem, providing an additional proficiency dice to the roll.</p>

<p><b>Political:</b> <i>The Esteemed’s visions have told her true, and guided by them, she has no fear as she acts.  One thing has been made abundantly clear, which is that a great threat prowls, not just beyond the borders of Eschaton, but perhaps it ranges far enough to threaten all of Elf kin within the World.  A threat of such staggering proportions is overwhelming, but the gods would not have informed her of this threat only to see her incapable of performing their will against it.</i></p>
<p><i>But while she believes with all her heart in what she has seen and heard, she knows that vision and prophecy are not sufficient enough cause for action; they may point the way to truth, but the truth itself must be found before all can be rallied to act against it.  And so, her quest for the Truth begins, in the humblest manner possible; through guiding her ilk to aid the fretful Aggro.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spycraft(Cloak and Dagger)</b> skill in Eschaton in order to provide the Stalkers, and the remaining Aggro, with further diligence, looking for the obscure threats while leaving the warriors to concern themselves with the obvious ones.  Once more, they turn to the knowledge of the Stones themselves, using the stunt The Hills Have Eyes, to allow them to know even that which they may not see themselves.</p>

<p><b>Military:</b> <i>Far away from Eschaton, Echo leads the Euclast into deadly conflict.  In spite of all warning, he regards the annoyances in Coldwater as little more than a distraction which has prevented him from spreading the unorthodox but intriguing Tactica that he has gleaned from the Swords among the greatest of the Aggro.  Frustrated by yet another obstacle on his path to greater strength for both him and his kind, he vents this frustration upon the unwitting foe.  But ignorance may be a double edged sword...</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Conventional Warfare(Offensive)</b> skill to dislodge the Coldwater elements that have bogged the sword elves down in house-to-house fighting.  If there is one locale that centuries of mountain and canyon fighting have prepared the Aggro for, it is close-quarters engagements such as these.  For this check, a Fate Point is being held in reserve, in order to Invoke for a reroll.</p>
<p><i>Providing that this headstrong charge is successful in alleviating the Sword Elves woes, and without undue trouble, Echo will then be able to demand his due recompense; to share the tactical training that he has received alongside all of his finest Warriors, putting them through trial after trial, and achieving in mere months what may have taken a decade or more of trials back in Eschaton.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to borrow the <b>Military Science(Drill)</b> skill from the Blade Elves, using the Fate point that was reserved for a reroll(if it was not already used) to Motivate them into doing so.  While Echo’s baseline intention is merely to take some of the most skilled of his Aggro warriors and create a new unit of Euclast, exactly as the old one is, the infiltration of foreign ideas and tactics from outside sources, Blade and otherwise, could result in unintended new tactics.</p>
<p>In short, this check gives leave to the DM to create a new type of unit, trained into the Memories of Shattered Hearth Division.</p>

<p><b>Mental:</b> <i>It has taken a great deal of time to prepare, but with the First’s absence from Eschaton and the arrival of spring, there is no clearer time for Drivel to attempt to motivate the collected Heads into putting further investigation into one of the First’s earlier obsessions; namely, investigation into a ritual which will retrace the steps of the First Generation, allowing barren mountainside to be coated with life-bearing loam.  While the First, obsessed with his own specializations, followed a more… industrial method for creating the substance, Drivel and the Heads believe that this is a job for good-old-fashioned Dirt Magic.  Perhaps they are correct.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use <b>Mysticism(Magic)</b> to develop, or at least begin to develop, a singular or series of ritual(s) which allows barren locations, such as Eparchy, where they currently experiment, to carry viable soil, capable of growing, among other things, the engineered protatotype.  With sufficient development, this new Mountain Loam could become a pivotal part of Crag re-expansion across the mountain peaks. </p>

<p>Results-</p>
<p><b>Economic-</b> Slabal has genuinely outdone herself this time. Apparently, this was her chance to really show what she is capable of. Eschaton is now a marvel, a testament to the skill of the Onagi and the dedication of one Slabal. It is a sight that would put the finest dwarven architects in awe, a work of art on par with the finest works of stonemasonry in the world. It is a monument to the unique abilities of the Crag, and indeed has wonders that would be outright impossible for other cultures to build. Eschaton has risen anew from the rubble, born again, and her wonders are perhaps greater than ever they were before.</p>

<p>Also with Slabal being Slabal, it’s exceedingly practical.</p>

<p>Eschaton has been blessed with Cast the Fifth Stone: Actualization. In addition to the sheer showiness of architects just deciding fuck it, let’s see what’s even possible here, Slabal has put a great deal of thought into the one Responsibility of her bloodline: Making sure no one ever has to do this shit again. </p>

<p>Slabal has constructed the Onagi’s workspaces with the specific and exceedingly practical purpose of ensuring that the maintenance and expansion of Eschaton will forever be enhanced. By strategically laying out the Onagi buildings and meticulously planning how they will interact with the surrounding infrastructure, this construction will make it so that as long as even a handful of Onagi live, Eschaton can be maintained. Barring that, it will always be possible to rebuild.</p>

<p>Unless this Aspect (or upgraded ones that expand it further) is completely Razed, all checks made involving building up or repairing the settlement of Eschaton will receive an automatic advantage.</p>

<p>Also of note, the other Onagi did something outside of their orders. They set aside a fairly considerable amount of resources and devoted it to creating a permanent marker to commemorate Slabal and how critical their precious Named has been in the rebuilding  of Eschaton. The exact form of this marker or monument is up to you, but Slabal may find it a bit distressingly… overstated.</p>

<p>Not helping that is the fact that Slabal, for the first time in her life, has gone over budget. No one is complaining, mind. After all, who is supposed to put all the quarried stone and gathered minerals to use except the Onagi?</p>

<p>It will take the Samra a while to restock the stores, though, so any Infrastructure checks made next turn will have the difficulty Upgraded.</p>

<p><b>Political-</b> The results that the Elpahka get are frustratingly almost as vague as the Esteemed herself’s visions. Having learned from her last expedition, the Esteemed asks the Elpahka (escorted by Stalkers, of course,) to make sure that they check areas outside of the walls themselves. The Stalkers happily assist, showing off their escape and evasion skills by estimating where someone would hide if they wanted to watch the city.</p>

<p>This produces results, but not exactly encouraging ones. The Elpahka find brief snippets of information. Like the brief glimpse of a wolf that the Esteemed got a few seasons ago, they are incomplete information that cannot be acted on, but make everyone nervous. Sandaled footfalls here, wolf prints there, the clink of metal… All telling signs of lowlanders, but no real proof.</p>

<p>On the upside, it’s not just Ledret this time. Others find signs as well. In the end, nothing seriously bad happens, but the only information found just puts the Elpahka more on edge... </p>

<p><b>Military-</b> Coyote War- The Battle of Riverhaven was a stunning success and a decisive victory. Coyote will no longer threaten you or your allies.</p>

<p>The combined force of dreamdust elves, Vaquero elves, fire elves, winged elves, and Machakw win a decisive victory in defense of the city against a larger enemy force. The Terror’s excellent defensive plan, as well as outstanding leadership by allied commanders, and a little bit of luck (and a lot of bagpipes) allowed for the victory.</p>

<p>Winged elf scouts managed to report the size and location of Coyote’s forces well before the arrived - 1400 troops in total: 800 militia, 400 soldiers, and 200 Cazadores. The huge force was slowed down by the complex network of traps that the dreamdust elves had laid. Navigating the traps added hours of delay to their advance. With the advanced warning, the defenders had time to arrange their forces.</p>

<p>Terror laid out her cavalry trap carefully, and set up the most elite units the elves had to defend the center. Vitally, the dreamdust elves prepared concealed positions on the flanks. The Machakw raider forces lay in wait, prepared to enclose the attacking Coyotes in a pincer maneuver.</p>

<p>No plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this day was no different. Coyote had fought alongside Breaker for years, and knew her tactics and capabilities well. He was able to successfully guess that Terror would use Breaker as bait for a cavalry charge. He did not fall for the trap. When he began his attack, he feinted a charge for Breaker with one unit of Cazadores. After Breaker maneuvered away from the charge, the first unit abruptly changed course for the weakest part of the fire elf lines while Coyote and his Cazadores charged around the fire elf lines to take a shot at Breaker.</p>

<p>It almost worked. By sheer luck, the route he chose for his surprise charge took his unit directly through the concealed position in which Hashkeh and his elite Machakw raiders lay in wait. Unable to see the position in time, Coyote’s Cazadores were well into the unit’s formation when Hashkeh sprung an attack. With weapons specifically designed to take riders off of horses, the Machakw tore into the Coyotes in a surprise close quarters assault.</p>

<p>Further, the fire elf Chevaliers were able to intercept the second unit of Cazadores that was charging the Milites, who would have likely been destroyed in the attack. As the initial charge floundered and the front lines erupted in battle, the rest of the Coyote forces engaged the allied lines.</p>

<p>Coyote’s Cazadores were quickly surrounded by fire and dreamdust elf units. Unable to bring the fury of a charge onto the surrounding infantry, Coyote attempted to punch through a gap between Machakw and dreamdust forces. Just as his forces were reaching open ground and about to pull back, Breaker intervened.</p>

<p>She had seen Coyote’s unit get trapped and quickly maneuvered her Cazadores to exploit his position. As soon as Coyote had created an opening large enough, she threw all of her quite considerable wrath into a ferocious cavalry charge, with her in the lead.</p>

<p>Breaker’s charge was one of the most astoundingly violent cavalry charges anyone on the field had ever witnessed. It was a hit so ruthless and so bloody even Lycan shock cavalry would blanch. Coyote’s Cazadores had already taken severe losses, and were unable to resist the fury of the charge. Breaker herself was the tip of the spear, tearing through the exhausted enemy until she found Coyote and killed him herself. Buenos Dias, Fuckboy.</p>

<p>Coyote was taken off the field with such surprising speed that he was unable to relay orders to his troops to adapt to the suddenly changed battlefield. His elite forces marched on the center and attempted to divide the allied line while the massed militia maintained their squares on the flanks, staying in formation.</p>

<p>The Coyote forces had no secondary leader. There was no one left who Coyote trusted enough to share the duties of command. Without leadership, the Coyote military kept following the initial plan. The Cazadores and soldiers kept fighting in the center, but were slowly overwhelmed by the elite fire elf and dreamdust elf forces. </p>

<p>The winged elves engaged the archers ferociously. The frontline soldiers had been expecting volleys of arrows to keep their foes at bay, but with the constant attack runs of the Harriers and accurate long range fire of the SkyHawks, they were unable to support the main force.</p>

<p>The Militia stayed in ranks on the sides. They were expecting an order to press the center once the elite forces made a foothold, but with Coyote dead that order never came. Most of the militia stayed in formation and did not directly engage in combat. A few units of Machakw and dreamdust elves were able to engage their front ranks and keep the bulk of the militia from being involved in the battle.</p>

<p>With no support, the elite frontline soldiers slowly collapsed under attack from the superior numbers of allied frontline troops. As the survivors fled the battlefield, Coyote’s forces began to unravel. Machakw broke through the Coyote lines and engaged the archers, nearly tearing them apart, and the last unit of Cazadores turned to flee. Their elite forces were broken.</p>

<p>With the army collapsing, Breaker again charged the remaining enemy Cazadores. They hit their former allies hard. A couple dozen survivors began to flee into the desert. Instead of pursuing, Breaker turned around and returned to the center of the battlefield. Standing on her horse and holding her new banner high, she called out for the remaining Coyote forces to surrender.</p>

<p>With nowhere left to turn, they did so. While the bulk of the militia was still intact, they had no leadership and no remaining professional army to support. They were not loyal enough to Coyote’s cause to continue the attack, and indeed many of them still felt loyal to Breaker.</p>

<p>The scattered surviving soldiers surrendered, but surprisingly the remaining Militia formally declared that they were defecting to Breaker’s Vaqueros.</p>

<p>Riverhaven is still a mess. There are currently more soldiers than civilians in the city, and there  is plenty of post-battle chaos as the allied military decides what to do with surrendered enemy forces and where to go next. Learning that the siege of Coldwater is ongoing, Breaker is determined to gather her new militia and her Cazadores and go to Coldwater to take it for herself.</p>
<p>As one of your allies. Of course.</p>

<p>The Siege of Coldwater begins on a high note. The river elves successfully infiltrate the Fort. Using Rulyrana's maps and their knowledge of Lycan fort building, their engineers are able to stealthily sabotage the Fort's defenses, as well as the outer walls. Coyote guards do eventually manage to spot the river elf saboteurs, but by the time they do it is far too late.</p>

<p>The walls of the Fort crumble, as do the gatehouses and armories, leaving the Fort essentially indefensible. Further, a large breach is created in the outer wall as the blade and dark elf forces arrive, allowing them to enter the city and immediately begin their attack.</p>

<p>This is where things start getting difficult. The Coyote officer in charge of the defenses, a man called Hawk, turns out to be surprisingly competent and shockingly ruthless. As the attack begins, the remaining division of soldiers abandons the ruined fort and make their stand in the city itself.</p>

<p>Hawk uses the situation to his advantage. The river elves had deliberately left openings for civilians to evacuate, but Hawk deliberately traps civilians in harm's way. Thanks to the river elves a large number are able to escape, but hundreds are still left in the city and trapped between the two armies.</p>

<p>Worse, Hawk sets up his headquarters at the church, the sturdiest building left standing. Matías had been using it as an emergency field hospital for civilians, but Hawk traps them there. He uses this group as leverage, threatening to kill them if his position is attacked or if the Militia lose their nerve.</p>

<p>The desperate Militia fight with surprising ferocity. The blade elves are not used to close quarters urban fighting, and with Katiin unwillingly to risk massive civilian casualties she commands them conservatively. Their offensive quickly stalls, bogged down in the city. The dark elves attempt to help, but even though they manage to slip through the Militia lines unnoticed they are unable to unstick the defending force from their home turf.</p>

<p>This goes on for weeks, then over a month. It starts to look like this is going to turn into a grueling urban siege. The blade elves begin establishing their own defenses, preparing for months of grueling urban operations.</p>

<p>Litoria, Katiin, and Trischal consider their options. With the dark elf sappers hiding behind enemy lines and the river elves still holding the docks, the two stealthy forces could make a surprise attack on the church itself. The position is fortified and there are civilian lives in the balance, but they won't get another shot and the position will only get more fortified with time.</p>

<p>That's when the Crag arrive. Furious at the "distraction" that the Coyote elves are causing, Echo descends from the mountains with the Euclast. Though they are the smallest force in the battle, they attack with shocking intensity. They don't even pause to rest. As soon as Echo has received a brief situation report, the Euclast attack the center of the Coyote forces and make a push for the stronghold.</p>

<p>With fresh troops, experience in close quarters fighting due to their mountainous home environment, and an aggressive strategy that has little regard for collateral damage, the Crag immediately begin to tip the scales.</p>

<p>This is causing a problem, however. Echo has only the barest cooperation with his ostensible allies, and appears to have a poor grasp of the situation. While they are handily succeeding tactically, Echo does not appear to understand the situation with the civilians. While they are definitely avoiding killing noncombatants, they do not appear to have the cultural context to understand why the Coyotes would hold their own people hostage and are thus ignoring it.</p>

<p>Realizing that the Crag are going to have a breakthrough, Litoria and Trischal predict that the Crag will make a push for the church. With little heed for the delicate situation, the Crag's attack will be seen coming and thus doom the hostages in the building.</p>

<p>With little choice and only a brief window, the dark and river elves decide that they must raid the church and free the hostages before the Crag break through the lines.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the weather is on their side. When they launch this operation, the sun is setting and a rare rainstorm is rolling in.</p>

<p>Using the poor visibility to their advantage, Trischal and Rulyrana scout the fortified church. The defenders have fortified the pavilion in front of the church, with infantry and archers watching the surrounding streets. They have build defensive barricades and scattered caltrops, broken glass, and sharpened stakes in the streets in front of the barricades. They have also deployed sharp eyed archers on the church roof, which Trischal is narrowly able to avoid being spotted by. The weather is on her side, for once. </p>

<p>With the exterior scouted but the situation inside the church still unknown, the elves decide that they can't risk detection by getting too close to the building. They prepare for the attack with the information they have.</p>

<p>The dark elf sappers decide that since patrols regularly watch the outside of the building, the safest way to breach the church's walls is to dig through the floor in a nearby building and then dig under the street and collapse the wall by destroying the foundation directly under it.</p>

<p>Despite a bit of time lost from a surprisingly sturdily built apartment floor, the dark elves manage to tunnel under the street and sabotage the wall without being detected and in good time. Knowing it's the signal to attack, the veteran sappers pull the structural supports and cause the wall to collapse and create a hole.</p>

<p>The rest of the dark elf sappers, led by Trischal, immediately rush the opening. Inside, they find nearly 150 civilians presses against the back side of the building. Hawk and some of his elite infantry are guarding them. None of them expected this.</p>

<p>Seizing the initiative, Trischal and the veterans descend on Hawk's group in a ferocious surprise attack. They press the advantage and the junior sappers surround the shocked infantry. Their attack decimates the unprepared infantry, completely disabling them and killing Hawk in the process.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hearing the attack begin, the river elves immediately assault the most heavily defended section of the barricades. The Crocodilians hit it with shocking speeds and force, driving the defenders off the wall as the Archerfish's arrows pin down their allies. Riding Sauvier, Litoria punches a hole straight through the center of the barricade and the Crocodilians rush into the square.</p>

<p>Seeing their defenses overwhelmed in mere moments, the remaining defenders retreat into the church while the rooftop arches attempt to force the river elves back. Inside, they encounter the dark elves.</p>

<p>The dark elves form a defensive line, preventing the enemy soldiers from reaching the civilians. Eina and her healer team rush into the church and begin healing and evacuating the civilians with help from a very surprised Matías.</p>

<p>The heavy infantry put their backs to the wall, preventing the dark elves from using their preferred tactics and flanking. Forced into a head on fight, the sappers do their best to hold the heavy infantry at bay while the civilians escape.</p>

<p>Outside, the Crocodilians attempt to break into the church itself but come under fire from the rooftop archers. The Archerfish exchange fire, drawing the attention of the enemy marksmen.</p>

<p>With surprising nerve, the lightly armed and armored sappers hold the line against the elite heavy infantry long enough for the civilians to escape. With the civilians safe and the defenses smashed, they make the call to fall back. They are taking casualties, and the Crag can handle what's left.</p>

<p>The swift sappers and Crocodilians flee into the rainy night with the civilians in tow, having taken few losses for what they gained and leaving the fortifications ruined. They took out nearly half the defending forces.</p>

<p>The Crag smash through the Militia lines and storm the church a couple of hours later. Surprisingly they find the enemy stronghold broken, with dozens of dead Coyotes in the streets. The remaining soldiers have holed up in the church itself.</p>

<p>The church is a stone building.</p>

<p>The Crag make short work of the walls and assault the soldiers within. Weakened, leaderless, and demoralized, they give up disappointingly quickly.</p>

<p>With Coyote and Hawk dead, the soldiers defeated, and their families safe, the Militia quickly surrender the following day.</p>

<p>Coldwater is yours, for now. Breaker is apparently coming to take control. If that is acceptable, Alpha Division volunteers to hold the city until Breaker returns.</p>

<p>If you trust her, that is.</p>

<p>The Euclast did not suffer any significant casualties.</p>

<p>Note: Riverhaven is safe and Coldwater is under allied control. Katiin, leading the largest force, takes the responsibility of occupying Coldwater until Breaker can organize the Vaqueros to return to the city and presumably take control of it. </p>

<p>The Euclast are too far from Eschaton to make it all the way back this turn (the furthest they can reach is Alfyr), but the situation is stable enough that any leaders attached to the Euclast can make it to the potluck if they wish.</p>

<p><b>Troop Training-</b> A rather insistent statement that “You said you would help us create an army of elves to safeguard the future, you didn’t list conditions!” is enough to make Grandmaster Indrek at least give this a try. They are stretched thin. Many of their instructors and senior staff (as well as most of the day to day folk) are currently deployed. The facilities, however, still exist, and most of the war scholars themselves are still here.</p>

<p>The warmasters set themselves to seeing how the Crag fight, and ho boy there are some culture clashes. Ehra himself, however, is determined to help the Crag. They are warriors, not soldiers. We can’t force them to be soldiers, but we might train them to be warriors who know how to cooperate with soldiers.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to tame or eliminate the naturally bloodthirsty and kind of wild temperment that Aggro are becoming famous for, the Warmasters instead attempt to channel and focus it. Rather than forcing them to fight like blade elves, they attempt to direct that intensity into a defensive posture rather than offensive. Taking many of the hard earned lessons of light infantry lately, they decide to take the resilient nature of the Crag, temper it with blade elf discipline, and then fuel it with Crag intensity. The resulting unit of Crag heavy infantry is… huh, wow, that actually worked.</p>

<p>For a first among Crag, they are clad in metal armor and carry metal weapons. These were forged for them by the blade elves, oddly with steel provided by the Crag. They are leery of the metal at first, but demonstrations of how effective it is slowly sway them.</p>

<p>The unit is equipped with weapons amd and armor the blade elves believe suit the Crag and their needs. The blade elves used Accessorizing, having their master armor smiths create a version of the plated armor that the swordelves use. This armor provides equal protection to the stone coats the Euclast favor, but allows the unit greater mobility in the unpredictable mountain environments the Crag often find themselves in. They have also been equipped with hammers, like their kin, but these hammers are thinner and lighter steel, mounted on a long pole and sporting a nasty spike at the top. With their natural stature, this unit is trained to use this fearsome weapon one-handed. Combining heavy armor with Crag resilience, this unit of heavy infantry is extremely durable. They are modeled on the Blade elf style of a mix of offense and defense. They are quite effective using those hammers on offense and are more mobile than other heavy infantry, but they are at their absolute best when defending a fixed location. The shields, armor, and spiked hammers work in tandem to create a bristling wall of metal and Crag muscle that even elite units will have difficulty unseating.</p>

<p>They focus their Crag intensity into an impressive espirit du corps. When they get hit, they just get mad about it. Rather than cracking, these warriors dig in and dare you to try to kill them. Lesser units might completely exhaust themselves simply trying to drag them down.</p>

<p>Given their resolute nature, the war scholars decide on a name for this incredibly durable unit of heavy infantry: Indomitables</p>

<p><b>Mental-</b> This is going to be a formidable ritual to develop. Creating something from nothing may be routine on an individual caster level, but on the scale of dozens of square miles it’s a whole other rockgame.</p>

<p>Still, progress is made. It should be within the means of the Crag to create and use this ritual, though extra resources may need to be put into it to create it or reliably cast it. Also notably, this will be medium risk magic as it is Conjuration on a very large scale, and accidents are possible. Still, following the Path of the ancestors, major strides are taken in developing this ritual.</p>

<p>Though you did not succeed, enough progress was made to allow for an Upgrade on your next check to develop this Ritual.</p>


<p>Congratulations! You have survived another year in your new homeland!</p>

<p>You receive your usual skill point to be distributed as you wish (don't forget your tower,) but the end of this year marks a major occasion.</p>

<p>The Coyotes posed a significant threat. This threat was addressed not just by one or two elven nations, but by all of you working together in a major combined operation. For the first time since the end of the war, you have displayed what you are capable of when the elves band together. Though your cooperation was tenuous at best and your ties still far from cemented, the display of force was quite impressive.</p>

<p>Due to the lessons of this conflict that were shared among all allied elves, you receive the Civilization Aspect Lessons of the Coyote War.</p>

<p>This Aspect may be invoked if a situation may be helped by the lessons and experiences your elves received in this conflict.</p>

<p>In addition, this Aspect provides a permanent upgrade to either one skill of your choice under the military branch or Logistics.</p>


<p><i>Without question, if it is to be said that the Crag prospered this year, then all praise goes to those of the Onagi bloodline for realizing their vision of an Eschaton rebuilt.  Even though the breakneck pace with which the reconstruction was planned, prepared, and executed would have caused many, even among their own number, to balk, the success they achieved cannot be questioned.  And yet, even for all of that, The Layer of the Path shows no signs of conclusion.  Indeed, she may only be getting started.</i></p>
<p><i>While many Onagi had keen opportunity to sharpen their talents in these busy times, the truth of the matter is that it was not truly a matter of learning new ways; instead, it was regaining the Confidence of the ways they already knew.  Through their efforts, it is not merely the Onagi who gained benefit, but all of Eschaton, and therefore, all of the Crag, leading them into a future far brighter, and far clearer, then the one they had mere months ago.</i></p>
<p>In recognition of the rebuilt Eschaton and all the advancements in infrastructure brought with it, the gained skill point is distributed into Development.  </p>
<p><i>But while Eschaton was reborn under the guidance of The Layre, another of Eschaton’s titled sought another rebirth.  Thrusting himself into the madness of the Lowlands, debasing himself, humbling himself, and ultimately, risking his own life to prove his worth, Echo of Blood has guided many of the Aggro through a similar reincarnation.  The Lessons of the Coyote War, to the Crag, are largely lessons that most other Lowlanders had already earned from untold centuries of life within their chaotic realm, but these were lessons sorely needed by the Aggro.  Through trial and tutelage, they have attained a strength thought lost to them; the strength to Change.</i></p>
<p>For the Crag, the Lessons of the Coyote War are ones of learning and self-improvement; it confers a permanent upgrade to their Military Science Skill. </p>
