<p>  </p> 

<p>A coy wind infiltrates your office.  It is one of a dozen reminders of the current focus of Onagi attention; a small hole, poked in your doorframe due to an inattentive acolyte, still remains open, allowing such a mild but smug atmosphere to pervade your most personal sanctum.  Fortunately, it only serves to bother you when you haven’t had anything else to distract you… and, as the <b>First Among Scholars</b>, there is usually something to distract you.  Like this bizarre tuber on your desk.</p>
<p>Unlike the lowland food you had endured previously, this one is much more light, airy, and soft.  Its skin, still warm to the touch.  Split down the center, you can see gentle curds of starch steaming softly in the infiltrating current.  The smell is… utterly alien.</p>
<p id="First">“So… you just baked it?  Nothing else?”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“No, nothing else, First Among Scholars.  Although no samples remain to test, I believe that the same might have been achieved with the original Lowland strain… but I cannot say for certain. “</p>
<p>You glance back up at Drivel.  You have mixed feelings about what you see there.  While he is by no means arrogant, or smug, his eyes lack much of the timid fear that pervaded them when you first began to exploit his time… however, the dark rings beneath them, and the hollowness of his cheeks, show that it is not confidence, but exhaustion, that has changed his demeanor.  You’re willing to accept exhaustion.  After all, his face likely mirrors your own.</p>
<p>However, while you are cautious about his declining fear, you cannot help but be astounded by, well, the <i>progress</i> he has made possible.  While he claims it is merely a matter of schedule-keeping and observation, his keen efforts at Drivelmandering… a clever term you coined for his unusual meeting and seating arrangements, as they twist and bend like a salamander… have resulted in more inter-study cooperation than you can remember in… well, since the darkest days of the Extermination.   Most would not consider that a favorable comparison.  Most are not you.  You understand all too well that progress always demands a cost.  </p>
<p>Gently, you pick up a stone spoon, and with no further fanfare, jam it into the soft innards of the tuber, and then jam the results into your mouth.</p>
<p>Ancestors.</p>
<p>The flavor is subtle, earthy, slightly bitter… a vast improvement over the majority of Lowlander sustenance.  You often questioned if their tongues functioned correctly.  Soft and pliable, you scarcely need to chew at all before the mash can make its way into your gullet.  Again, a marked improvement.  As it slides into your belly, you feel it resting comfortably there.  And that was but one bite; many more remain in this single specimen alone.</p>
<p>When dealing with Drivel, you have often tried to compose yourself, to make sure he understands your relative positions.  Today, you will fail in this attempt.</p>
<p id="First">“Remarkable.  It’s so… edible.  Palatable, even.   And filling.  This … what is it called?  A Potato?”</p>
<p>Drivel visibly winces, and his eyes stare, haunted, into the distance.  He recovers, though not quickly.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“There has been some… disagreement… about what… or, specifically, how... exactly it is called.  Some say, as you have, that it is a ‘potato’.  Others, a ‘potato’.  Others still insisted that it simply must be pronounced ‘potato’.  An entire week was spent on this discussion.”  </p>
<p>His eye twitches, and he sets it still with one hand.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“Considering that we are attempting to naturalize the p… -lant, I suggested to the collected Studies that perhaps it be best to name it in the manner of tradition.  As such, we now refer to this strain as a ‘Starch Root.’  Not as exotic as p- -reviously named, but causes far fewer arguments.”</p>
<p>And there it is.  That alone sums up Drivel’s subtle brilliance.  You have little doubt that were you involved, you would have made absolutely sure that those pompous heads realized the errors of their ways, no matter how long it took.  A compromise like that… it would have looked weak.  Foolish.  But that’s what they <i>expect</i> from Drivel.  And he is more than willing to exploit that expectation.  Put quite simply, he is brave enough to be seen as a weak willed coward.</p>
<p>Genius.</p>
<p>And, this once, you are not afraid to tell him so.</p>
<p id="First">“Incredible work, Drivel.  One might even construe it as Genius, in a way.  It is a definitive foot forward on a task that long needed addressing, and lo and behold, you have addressed it adequately.”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“...Thank you, First Among Scholars.  I am glad I could serve the Bakshish so.”  </p>
<p>Hah! Clever lad.  He’s hesitant.  He knows that praise like that isn’t given without the promise of more trials attached.  At this point, it would be insulting to disappoint his expectation of disappointment.</p>
<p id="First">“Indeed, you have served admirably.  And, Ancestors willing, you will continue to do so.  While this shows significant improvement, now efforts must be made to see if this development can be paired with the ones I made last year;  While I have no doubt that these will take to artificial soil as easily as natural, there is only one way to be certain.</p>
<p id="First">Drivel, as you have performed so well on this project, I’d like you to take charge of another.  As I’m sure you are aware, the outpost of Eparchy is currently reliant on shipments of food and forage from Eschaton… it was my hope that a newly designed strain as this, paired with my aforementioned loam, could serve to make that outpost, and potential future ones, far more self-sustaining.  As we now have both Earth and Root, it would seem that there is no time like the present to begin some practical experiments!  As you have made yourself familiar with the strengths of the various Heads of Studies, I’ll leave it to you to decide who may serve in that capacity best.  I’m certain the promise of such amazing new discoveries will trump any concerns they may have about the… humble conditions present at the outpost.  After all, what True Scholar would balk at any hardship if the promise of Knowledge is present?”</p>
<p>You struggle to keep your grin warm, and not vicious, as you look into his face.  You can see the exhaustion and despair there, but again, you cannot help but admire how he keeps them in check.  He is silent for a moment, then finally responds.  </p>
<p>“...Of course, First Among Scholars.  I relish the opportunity.  I will make the arrangements as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>...Now you struggle to keep your grin at all.  You had expected him to protest, or at least ask for some advice, but instead he just sounds… defeated.  Hrm.</p>
<p>...Something about that twinges in the back of your head.  A long distant memory.  A memory of when you, yourself, took such a defeated tone.  To Sivens.</p>
<p>...Shit.  Are you feeling <i>bad</i> for Drivel?</p>
<p>...You are. Ancestors preserve.  Where the eighth hell is <i>that</i> coming from?  Yes, you don’t envy his situation, but it’s trials like this that can make a Crag’s place in history!  Sentiment doesn’t enter into it, it’s just the way things are done; it’s not like any of the others feel that way toward him!</p>
<p>...Right?</p>
<p>...<i>Is</i> that Right?</p>
<p>...You definitely need to take a break at some point.  You clearly aren’t thinking straight.</p>
<p>It seems that Drivel has taken your prolonged silence as a dismissal… which isn’t entirely incorrect.  Still, against your better judgement, as he stands in the open door (letting more of that sneaky wind in, dammit), you speak once more.</p>
<p id="First">“Drivel?”</p>
<p>He turns to look at you.  Worry is setting in on his face.</p>
<p id="First">“Let me know if I can help you with your preparations.  I know that some of the more ...entrenched Heads can be somewhat inflexible at times.  Just inform me if you run into any problems, I’ll make sure they understand their priorities.”</p>
<p>There is a look of surprise on his face.  Quite frankly, he’s not the only one.  Merely signing the affirmative, he leaves, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>Welp.  Looks like your options are to consider what the hells just happened there… or to ignore it, and do something more productive.</p>
<p>Well, that’s an easy choice for you.  With Drivel gone, you unlock your desk once more, holding aloft the glinting pipeline of knowledge that you have been vigorously exploiting for the last few weeks.  Sure enough, there is another response waiting there.</p>
<p>Ah, excellent.  Just the distraction you needed.</p>
<hr>
<p>In your line of work, your first, and foremost, responsibility and skill is to be aware of your surroundings, at all times.  To pick out the fine details, to notice small differences, and to be ever alert for a telling change that signals the time to strike.</p>
<p>However, you did not even need a fraction of a fraction of your ability when you walked back into your familiar home… at least, you <i>think</i> it is.</p>
<p>Walls, free of cracks or divots, are perfectly polished to a marble sheen.</p>
<p>Buttresses and columns have been reinforced and restored, removing the slight list once obvious in the central hall.</p>
<p>Racks, made of freshly carved wood, stand filled with row upon row of keenly willed weaponry, either perfectly sharpened or blunted to task.</p>
<p>And, most telling of all, there isn’t even a single trace of high moss or creeping mold to be found <i>anywhere</i>.</p>
<p>You are <b>Stalker Embebi</b>, and right now, you are feeling <i>completely</i> out of your element.  While all of those features may have technically been flaws, they were also part of what made the Circle feel like… well, like home.  It felt lived in, ancient and wise, it’s sagging flagstones a testament to the countless generations of Aggro who had trained, lived, and even died here.  Now… it’s almost like they lifted up the original building and slid in a new one underneath.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t the only shocking change awaiting you when you returned to Eschaton.  The walls, including the crumbling one you used to reach your favorite vantage point, had been rebuilt, in some places stronger than they had been previously.  The Stone Gates once more opened and closed instead of just resting partially open, immobile.  Given your keen perception, you could probably spend all day listing the new and unsettling differences that had been committed on your once familiar territory.</p>
<p>...Okay, that might be going a little <i>too</i> dramatic.  Still, you’re willing to cut yourself some slack; the last season has been an exercise in carefully planned futility, so the last thing you needed on your return was a shock like this.  </p>
<p>And Ancestors, you wish that that was the <i>worst</i> shock waiting for you.  No, that was just delivered to you by the short, purple haired Crag who cornered you moments ago.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“...So there hasn’t been any sign of him <i>at all</i>?  I thought I might have just missed him…”</p>
<p>She shakes her head.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“No, Embebi, I’m afraid not.  He has not returned since setting out for the Lowlands.   I had suspected that he may have met up with you before returning, but I can see from your response that this was not the case.  This is somewhat distressing.”</p>
<p><i>Somewhat distressing.</i>  Nulljest.  All things considered, the only reason you could think for Echo’s absence at this point is either he’s dead… or someone else important is.  You aren’t certain which is more likely.  Some of the Lowlanders play for keeps.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“I am now uncertain of how to proceed.  I do not wish to impose, but would it be possible for you to act in his stead?”</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p id="Embebi">“...In his stead?  What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Her face is impassive (like that needed to be said), but she stares a moment; you spent enough time with her to know that means that she is also confused about something.  You sigh.  At least you know how to handle this.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“When you reported Echo’s absence, I assumed your concern was for his wellbeing, as it is possible some ill may have befell him.  Is that the case?”</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Ah.  I see the confusion.  No.  I am not concerned about his wellbeing.  I do not think it is possible anything left in the Lowlands could likely cause him significant harm.  My concern is rooted in some unorthodox assistance I require of the Aggro, but in his absence I do not know the proper way to petition for this assistance.”</p>
<p>Ah.  Of course.  She’s not concerned about Aggro, just concerned about getting something out of you. Figures.  </p>
<p>...Dang, that’s a little hostile, when you think about it.  You may need to take a break.  You clearly aren’t thinking straight.  You’ve spent long enough with The Layer to know she doesn’t have a self-centered organ in her body.  If she’s asking for help, it’s only because she has no other option.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Well, you could have brought it before the Named, but I can see why that might have been a bit confusing since usually Echo’s so hands-on.  Well, I can talk to them for you… I might not be named, but I do have some clout with the bigwigs.  What’s the situ?”</p>
<p>She looks into your eyes for a moment longer than is really appropriate, then starts her spiel.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“While I do not wish to place further duress upon the Aggro, and specifically upon your Stalkers, as you are, I am afraid I can think of few better suited to solve a supply issue I have encountered.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Supply issue?”</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Yes.  I am currently organizing our available resources in an attempt to restore many of the Temples that were ruined or demolished recently.  Unfortunately, the next set of structures I am attempting to focus the Onagi’s attention toward required a fair quantity of semiprecious stones, used in the creation of various polished luminescents, glasses, and aesthetically pleasing decorations.  Eschaton’s local supply of many of these stones, such as agates, aventurines, jades, jaspers, lapis lazuli, prehnite, and rhodonite have been largely exhausted.  While many of your recent expeditions revealed sufficient small deposits of such material, these deposits often rest in places that are remote, difficult to reach, and often are the demesne of wild creatures of violent nature.   Sent on their own, I do not believe the Samra extractors would meet with much success.  As such, I was hoping that the Aggro could provide guidance and protection as they seek to restore our needed materials.”</p>
<p>That… sounds entirely reasonable.  You’re not sure why they would need so many odd types of stone, but that’s not really your place to question.  That would probably put a momentary kibosh on your recent explorations, since you’d need to draft out several of the Stalkers to assist in guidance… but actually, that might provide another opportunity, now that you think about it.  </p>
<p>One of the reasons you’ve had to be so cautious recently with your Stalkers isn’t just because, well, you’d feel pretty shitty if you got any of your fellows killed over some mere expeditionary work, but also there’s the more rational problem that there just plain isn’t enough of you to risk… uh… risking them.  And the Stalkers certainly aren’t the only Specialists to have that problem.  A simple run like this, however… a seasonal jaunt, along previously ventured trails, protecting against mere wildlife… why, that’s a perfect opportunity to see if any of the new up-and-coming ristars among the Aggro fit the bill to join your esteemed ranks.</p>
<p>You smile to yourself.  Slabal, of course, just stares, awaiting a proper response. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Honestly, I don’t see any problem with that.  In fact, I don’t think it’ll even require any real effort to convince the Named of it’s worth.  I’m pretty sure I can couch it in terms that even they can’t find good reason to refuse.”</p>
<p id="Slabal">“That is most gratifying to hear.  With that confirmation, I can begin preparations using what material we currently have available, and ideally we will be able to receive collections of rarer stones as necessary to avoid delays.  I thank you for your assistance, Stalker Embebi.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Sure, no problem.”  </p>
<p>...Huh.  She’s still hanging around.  Usually, when The Layer is done with a conversation, she just kind of… wanders off, intent on her next task.  However, now she’s just standing there… staring.  At you.  It’s kind of unnerving.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“...Is there something else?”</p>
<p>She is quiet for a moment longer, but then finally speaks… although it is with a degree of hesitation.  Odd, for her.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Stalker Embebi, it is my understanding that you have frequent communication and close contact with Echo of Blood.  While it is not entirely appropriate, I am considering whether I could ask you about him.  While I understand it would likely be more appropriate to address him directly, his recent absence, and generally busy schedule, have prevented me from doing so.”</p>
<p>Wow.  She’s managed to make something that sounds pretty straightforward sound incredibly awkward.  In spite of yourself, you can’t help but wonder what she wants to know.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Aff, I know him pretty well.  What’s your query?”</p>
<p id="Slabal">“I was wondering whether he had an intended in the upcoming Next Generation.  Given your close relationship, I might have assumed it was you, but I have learned that such assumptions may be incorrect.”</p>
<p>...Heh</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>HAH</p>
<p id="Slabal">“...Are you well?”</p>
<p>Ah, crap, you were trying to keep your hysterical laughter internalized.  It takes you a moment before you can respond, long enough for her face to actually betray a small amount of concern (read: raised eyebrow)</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Eheh… heh… sorry, whew, no, no no.  I’m <i>definitely</i> not his intended.  In fact, I am pretty sure he doesn’t have any, this time around.  If memory serves, he usually isn’t very subtle about that.  Why? Are you running recon on him?”  </p>
<p>You put a teasing note on your last phrase, but as you might have predicted, it seems to have no impact on her.  Instead, she just keeps staring.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“It is something I have been weighing in idle time, what exists of it.  Before I undertook a Rite of Position, my lineage indicated that I would likely be Aggro.  While it did not express strongly, there might be some merit to such pairing.”</p>
<p>Now <i>that</i> is surprising.  Possibly even more than hearing the Layer of the Path is scoping out your sib. Come to look at it, The Layer is unusually… stocky, for an Onagi.  But ‘did not express strongly’... well, that’s understatement, but it’s par for the course in her phrasing.  </p>
<p>As for considering such a pairing… well, in this <i>one</i> case, you’ll probably let propriety guide your actions.  That’s not really your place to butt in- that’s between the two of them.  On the other hand…</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Well, if you want, if… sorry, <i>when</i> he gets back, I could mention you to him.  I know his schedule <i>seems</i> busy, but really there’s a lot of it that’s… probably unnecessary.” </p>
<p>Like all the weightlifting when he’s already the size and width of a load-bearing pillar. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“I’m sure I could convince him to make some time to discuss it.”</p>
<p>She stares at you again.  Does that really bear repeating?  Shh, don’t sass me, brain.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“The offer is appreciated, but as I am currently still evaluating available options, I would not wish to mislead.  I am not currently intent on intending him.  It is merely convenient to know whether the possibility exists.”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Fair enough.  Chances are, he’s more likely to be in Eschaton on any given day than I am, anyway.  The Outlands beckon, aff?”</p>
<p id="Slabal">“As you say.  I thank you for that information, Stalker Embebi.”</p>
<p>And with that, now she takes her leave, uncornering you.</p>

<p>...Hrm.  Come to think of it, that does raise the question of whether you have any intended you’ve been considering.</p>
<p>...Well, you could think on that, OR, hear you out, you could start going over the maps you recovered from the last expeditions to make a plan for that stone-gathering mission.</p>
<p>Well, it’s a no brainer as to which is more fun.  Maproom, ho!</p>
<hr>
<p>You are <b>The Esteemed.</b></p>
<p>And threats lurk anywhere. </p>
<p>They could take any form, be malicious, or merely misfortunate, they are all around, all encompassing, and it’s up to you to spot them, and you’ve failed, failed, <i>failed</i> so frequently to spot them, to anticipate them, to even <i>recognize them when directly in front of you</i>, and you can’t just quit, no, no, you’ve fouled that up as well, long ago you should have made preparations, you should have begun the process, and now it’s too late, and everyone knows it, anything you started would be at best quarter finished, but they all say nothing, they merely judge beneath cold faces, hating, pitying, you don’t know which is worse, but far worse than that worst is the knowledge that no matter what you may succeed in you’ve failed at so much and that ultimate failure looms over your…</p>

<p>On second thought, you shouldn’t be The Esteemed right now.  It’s probably not in anyone’s best interest.</p>
<hr>
<p>You are <b>Entrep.</b></p>
<p>...You know? Entrep?  The Onagi who was now leading construction efforts over Eparchy?  Yeah, you haven’t had a lot to do recently, at least not anything that was particularly interesting, but that’s about to change, innit?</p>
<p>After all, the Warehouses of Iron have been filling at a prodigious rate; As the need for outside sustenance has slowly declined, so has the amounts of that ferric substance that you’ve shipped swampward to be traded.  Of course, that is not to say that Eparchy is soon to have fulfilled its purpose; quite the contrary, soon, it will be time for The Layer’s long-term plan to be put into action.  </p>
<p>Already, you have been siting out new quarries and gravelyards for the Samra to extract from, and distributing the plans to the handful of Onagi left here to see the plan through.</p>
<p>Soon now, soon.  Soon, Eschaton will be prepared for The Layer’s grand vision… and Eparchy will be the lynchpin of that new, coming era.</p>
<p>Countless beautiful designs spread on the desk before you, each tantalizing in their own way.  How will you choose?  How could you choose?  </p>
<p>Suddenly, a strong gust of wind throws open the window shutters, which, you’ll admit, you carelessly left unbarred.  Yet, in that gust, providence; scattered and thrown, but one sheaf remains on your desk.  Sturdy, stolid, it stands alone.</p>
<p>A telling wind blows over the mountainside.  It dictates Providence.</p>

<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic:</b> <i>The People are fed, The City secure.  The most critical needs have been seen to, the bodies of those who inhabit Eschaton.  But what of their minds?  It has been clear to all, even to Slabal, that the People of Eschaton are hurting, even without hunger, even without violence.  So much has been lost, and so little has returned to replace it.  However, of all the Bloodlines, the one which has weathered these times with greatest grace are those who she seeks now to support.  The Elpahka, ever the guidance and heart of the Crag, once gave their wisdom from great temples and humble shrines, decorated in scintillating patterns; these were not to demonstrate affluence or superiority, but to provide an enlightening atmosphere, a place of harmony in which solemn meditation could allow the Elpahka to best see The Path and guide the Crag people along it.  With determination, work, and perhaps even sacrifice, The Layer will see to it that this essential environment is restored, and Community returned to the Crag people.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Infrastructure(Enrichment)</b> Skill to replace the aspect Cast the Second Stone: Safety with Cast the Third Stone: Belonging. Once again, the Samra come to their aid, but this time, it is paired with the efforts of the recently honored Aggro, as their guides and guards protect the dutiful extractors as they take from a hostile world what is needed to return clarity and harmony to the bloodline most responsible for tying all Crag together.  Invoking We are Uncut, Slabal once more focuses on her, and her people’s, drive to restore the Crag to what they once were… and what they could be.  This provides an extra proficiency die to the roll.  In addition, her tireless leadership continues to be an example to all Onagi… and, perhaps, all Crag in general.  She provides a Boost die, as well.</p>

<p><b>Political:</b> <i>For reasons that are becoming a growing concern to the Elpahka, The Esteemed’s mood remains dark, foul, and utterly impregnable.  She fears danger and doom from every corner, and there are even whispers among her bloodline that she may finally be becoming infirm.  However, there are always those who preach patience; The Esteemed, so full of ancient knowledge, can be difficult to decipher.  It is best to leave her to her moods, and do what must be done to safeguard the soul of Eschaton in the meantime.</i></p>
<p><i>Still, although doubtful, they would be fools to completely ignore The Esteemed’s caution.  They remain watchful for the unusual or out of place… but perhaps, pursue such actions with less diligence than before, following passive observation, as not to further concern the public.  </i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Spycraft(Cloak and Dagger)</b> skill on Eschaton.  However, this time, they will forego the use of the associated stunt; after all, the stones have spoken, and to be a stoneworrier is to court foolishness.  </p>

<p><b>Military:</b> <i>Echo is absent.  Curiously, this is cause for less concern than one might expect; few believe it possible for any true misfortune to befall the stony behemoth.  Curiously, in his absence, it is not any of The Named who show initiative, but Stalker Embebi… who, as all jest, is only lacking Name because she would never sit still long enough for the Ceremony.   True to form, her newest ambitions also take her, and many other Stalkers, away from Eschaton, but this time to nearby areas, charted, and relatively safe.  The purpose for this is twofold; to help the Onagi… and to evaluate the Great Host of the Aggro for those who embody the essential qualities of the Stalker.  Should fortune shine, it may be possible to find enough of these souls that the Stalkers could become more than a mere ancillary, instead becoming a cohort in their own right.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use <b>Military Science(Drill)</b> to create Talcsome Aggro Stalkers. Beginning their training from scratch, Talcsome units are at the beginning of a long road of experience.  These Talcsome will be placed into their own new Division, Vigor of Youth.   Utilizing the new improvements provided by the Onagi, this training promises to be exceptionally fruitful; the Aspect Cast The Second Stone: Safety is Invoked in order to add a Proficiency dice to the check.</p>

<p><b>Mental:</b> <i>While Drivel begins the tedious prospect of motivating elderly scholars to conduct research in a place that involves more than a few minutes of walking, the real learning is being conducted alone by The First… or, in truth, only partially alone.   Indeed, having had the Feaher (mis)placed into his hands, he has proceeded to bombard the Fire Elf feather with a daily barrage of probing questions.  First and foremost on his mind; completing the task he originally set into the Lowlands to complete.  Namely, he must understand not only what lowlanders are, with all their diverse shapes and traits, but also how they are, as understanding the pressures and selections they make will grant him invaluable insight into how said selections could be best utilized within the formation of, dare he think it… a new Path, custom drafted by none other than Renyan Elematich, The First Among Scholars!</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Academics(Research)</b> skill in order to gather information on Lowlander Population Dynamics.  Through sufficient research into this field, he may be able to make progress on the current roadblock that threatens The Next Generation… although this will only be one step of many.</p>
<p>A complication rests heavily on this check, however; The main source through which his knowledge is gained is none other than The Fire Elves, and in particular, their chief intellectual, The Hunger.  It may be conceivable that he has his own plans in mind for what the Crag should know, especially as the probing nature of the questions becomes more clear....</p>

<p>End of Turn </p>
<p>Results-</p>
<p><b>Economic-</b> You have successfully replaced the Second stone with the Third, that of Belonging. Slabal continues to earn her reputation, and she is quickly becoming a central figure in the story of the restoration of the Crag. She has seen to it that the Crag have what they need to restore their bodies, and now she sees to it that they have what they need to restore their souls.</p>

<p>Speaking of Belonging, that was something sorely needed this season. The Aggro have been restless and directionless for some time. Now, it finally feels like they are doing what they were supposed to do from the beginning: Protect the other bloodlines. Aggro morale improves in general.</p>

<p>The Esteemed still seems like something is deeply troubling her. The improvements are healthy for her, but even Slabal is beginning to notice the heavy weight that sits on the Esteemed...</p>

<p><b>Political-</b> All is well, but Ledret is having a hard time believing it. Even though every report comes back saying that the Crag are recovering, indeed even beginning to thrive, but Ledret cannot help the creeping notion that something is wrong. She can't place her finger on it, but she feels like she is missing something catastrophically important. Not the Crag in general, but her specifically.</p>

<p>Not helping this is a persistent perplexing dream that comes to her near nightly. Not a necessarily horrible or threatening one, but a frustratingly vague one.</p>

<p>Ledret - and she feels like Ledret more than the Esteemed in this dream - sits at the edge of a deep chasm, the bottom of which is too deep to be seen. Beside her sits a bowl of warm brew.</p>

<p>On the other side of the chasm, just barely within her vision, sits a white wolf with blue eyes. In that strange kind of dream logic, she knows it is the one she calls the Seeker. The Seeker watches her quietly. Not threateningly, not hopefully, not even judgmentally, just giving that same cool gaze that Ledret clearly remembers the elf giving her. Sizing her up? Regarding her, maybe.</p>

<p>Oddly, after a few nights, she realizes something. This wolf is different than the one the stones described last season.</p>

<p>Even stranger, beside the wolf sits another bowl identical to Ledret's, though it is empty.</p>

<p><b>Military-</b> Congratulations, Embebi has successfully recruited the first unit of new Aggro in years and created a new division. Though they are small in number and relatively green, they are capable enough in their own right. They are capable of defending the Onagi in the field and capable of manning the new defenses at Eschaton. Though they wouldn't last long in a pitched battle, they could prove quite difficult to dig out of Eschaton's well-prepared defenses.</p>

<p>Embebi's new recruits reinvigorate the previously struggling Aggro. Though they are not nearly as combat capable as their senior compatriots, they bring a sense of vigor and hopefulness to the Aggro. They bring with them  a sense of drive and purpose - and no small amount of loyalty to Embebi personally.</p>

<p>Alarmingly, Embebi finds a small note tucked into her gear one morning late in the season. The note is written on lowlander parchment, and in impeccable Elven:</p>

<p>"I have what is rightfully yours. I wish to deliver it to you, and to speak again of our linked future and philosophy. I will be waiting."</p>

<p>On the note is a map, indicating a location not far from where Embebi met the wolf elf Vesnia.</p>

<p><b>Mental-</b> Well, First is successful. His harassment of the Hunger apparently eventually breaks through. Since this is highly dependent on another player, I'll leave it between you two what exactly First manages to browbeat out of the Hunger over the course of several months. Perhaps it's information about the curious way that Lycans shaped the blade elves by selecting better soldiers (somewhat hypocritical considering how violently they reacted to your own selection process,) or perhaps it's information on the bizarre and poorly understood way that the fire elves became what they are.</p>

<p>Regardless of the specifics, per the rules First's research is successful. It is enough for an Upgrade on your next check to resolve this population bottleneck.</p>

<p><b>War Games</b>: Unfortunately, no one is able to spare enough soldiers for there to be true war games this season. Still, nearly everyone was able to send at least a handful of elites.</p>

<p>Breaker and a few of her Cazadores are able to demonstrate what they're capable of in open cavalry combat. Litoria and a few of the Crocodilians who aren't still recovering from their losses demonstrate some of their river ambush tactics. Dark elves demonstrate some of their close quarters fighting in the fort. Dreamdust elves give primers on night fighting and desert tactics. The fire elves are able to demonstrate shield walls and a phalanx. Shadimon isn't able to fly, but Shrike is able to demonstrate the aerial tactics they have developed with the blade elves. The blade elves show off the offensive and defensive capabilities of the swordelves. Even the mighty and terrifying Echo, made even more terrifying by horrible burn scars now covering nearly half his body, shows up with a few of his Euclast warriors and show off their brutal front line slugging potential.</p>

<p>All in all, while it is not exactly what was planned  seeing the best of the best show off what they can do is good for morale. The morale boost will provide all who participated with a boost die on the Drill trapping of Military Science next season.</p>
