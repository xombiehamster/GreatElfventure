<p>A nondescript wind blows over the mountainside.  Well, perhaps it would be more descript to others.  However, near as you can tell, it is a wind like any other; not too hot, not too cold (at least not for the season), not too strong, etc etc.  That said, you’re probably not the best suited to make such deliberations on meteorological adjectives; Since you are <b>Slabal</b>, you tend to think in more concrete terms.</p>
<p>Besides which, your mind is currently occupied with more concerns than what the wind is up to- although in a broader perspective that is one of your concerns, structurally speaking- and, in particular, your concerns have lied with the task that lies ahead of you… or, more appropriately, above you, at the top of the stairs which wind towards the Esteemed’s Pagoda.</p>
<p>You have not spoken with the Esteemed… with Ledret… in many months now.  You have had justifiable reason for this; after all, your labors of the last few seasons have absorbed nearly all of your conscious hours, and even some of the other ones.  But as you worked among her fellow Elpahka, seeing to their specifications and their memories of structures long ruined, the subject of her increasingly erratic behavior became one that not even you could overlook.  Indeed, to hear of it came as somewhat of a shock- you knew that Ledret often was prone to… emotional concerns.  And yet, it would never have occurred to you that they could result in such a drastic change as you’ve been told of.</p>
<p>And, if that concern alone was not enough, you also have not been deaf to the many attempts by those you’ve consulted, to put it bluntly, guilt trip you into speaking with her.  It seems that your frequent talks prior had not gone unnoticed.  Oh well.  Truly, you do not know what you can do to help… only that staying away evidently hasn’t worked, so that only really leaves the opposite as your next option.</p>

<p>As you reach the Pagoda’s apex, you can see that Ledret has ordered the massive curtains hung.  Odd, usually that’s reserved for when the winds are high, or piercingly chill.  That’s probably also not a good sign.  But as you push your way past the heavy fabric, gaining entrance to the dark interior, and gaze upon Ledret’s form, cast in shadow, dimly lit by only a single heatless fire hung at the center of the ceiling, you can immediately tell that she looks… well, not really any different than she did before.  Huh.</p>
<p>From what you’d been told, you were kind of expecting her to be sickly, or wasting, or maybe even twitching wildly.  Nothing of the sort.  She’s just… there. Sitting, still, on her Ox.  Like normal.  You cannot help but feel a combination of mild relief and a shade of anticlimax.</p>

<p>She jerks slightly, and it is only when you hear her voice that you understand why the Elpahka are so concerned.</p>
<p id="Esteemed" class="whisper">“Slabal? Is that you?  It is your tread, your breath.  Are you here, Slabal?  Are you beside me once more?”</p>
<p>You are generally not one for strong reaction or emotional displays, but to hear the voice of the Esteemed- her voice, once unshakeable, the strength which continued in the midst of all of her other evident decay- to hear it tremble, to quail, sends a shiver down your spine.  Oddly enough, that shock somewhat lessens the blow of the next one you see.  As her eyes flash open for a moment, you see nothing but a white fog covering her orbs.  Her cataracts, so carefully maintained.  She has let them grow out.  </p>
<p>Overall, it’s fairly disconcerting.</p>
<p>Not really knowing the proper way to approach this situation, you opt for the only obvious one.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Yes, Ledret.  I am here.”  </p>
<p>Hrm.  Seems insufficient.  </p>
<p id="Slabal">“I… apologize, for how long it has been since we spoke last.  I have been preoccupied with my tasks.  I am aware that you counseled against such obsession, but there never appeared to be an ideal time to stop.” Indeed, even now is not such a time; There is still much to be done in order to prepare for the next stage.</p>

<p id="Esteemed" class="whisper">“Oh, Slabal, dutiful Slabal.  It is well you have disregarded my ravings.  Through your rebellion, you have profited our kind.  How few others can say opposite?  But you are here now.  Come, to my side.  I had wondered, prayed, whether I would hear you again, before the End.”</p>

<p>That mild sense of unease grows more prominent the more you hear The Esteemed speak.  Not just wavering, her words are disjointed, as though she speaks while in great pain.  As she requested, you approach your traditional sitting point at her table.  You scan her form for injury, for signs of ailment or contagion… but nothing is evident.  You’re not sure whether that’s a good sign, or a bad one.</p>
<p>Speaking of bad signs… </p>
<p id="Slabal">“The ‘End’, Ledret?  What do you refer to?”  </p>
<p>You’ve got a nasty suspicion, as she’s spoken on it before, but rarely in such blunt terms.</p>
<p>Her expression grows more sour.  </p>
<p id="Esteemed" class="whisper">“The End of The Esteemed, Slabal.  I fear the time comes swiftly.  And if it does not, it should.  I am plagued, Slabal, plagued by visions, by portents, by countless baying reminders of all the threats which face our people, and yet, though my world is a cacophony of prophecy I cannot see the union, cannot read the words.  I cannot see the signs for what they are, Slabal.  Indeed, had I ever?  And if I am truly without insight, then what use am I to Eschaton? Why would I remain here?  Just to suffer?”</p>
<p>Ah.  So yes.  A bad sign.  You cannot help but feel frustrated.  It is often difficult to speak to her when she is in this mindset.  Especially as you can scarcely understand it.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“I’m not sure if those concerns are as… truly imminent as you say, Ledret.  In terms of threats, recent developments and reinforcements of many of the critical defensive points of Eschaton should give us an advantage should some other external force seek to cause us harm.”</p>
<p>The Esteemed grimaces, her eyes clenched shut.  You can see as her form starts to sway slightly back and forth.</p>
<p id="Esteemed" class="whisper">“Even if walls and towers are enough to protect the body of the Crag, I fear that predators come too for our souls, Slabal.  And here I am, incapable.  I cannot see the light which will cast darkness away from the Soul of Eschaton, Slabal.  Darkness which even now circles ever tighter around us.”</p>
<p>‘Circles ever tighter…’, what is that even supposed to mean?  If you didn’t know better... which, upon reflection, you may not <i>actually</i> know better, but for now let’s assume you do… you would suspect The Esteemed of giving into theatrics.  Still, if she is truly concerned for the soul of the people of Eschaton, perhaps your recent successes will give some comfort.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“That may also not be as dire as you believe, Ledret.  Only recently, we completed our renovation and reconstruction of many of the Guidant Halls of the Elpahka.  Even now, those of your Bloodline have moved to fill them to capacity, tending to the concerns and wellbeing of the Crag people.”</p>
<p>She opens her cataract stricken eyes at you, fully this time… surprise, possibly even shock, is written on her face.  Did… did she not know about that?  How long has she secluded herself here?</p>
<p id="Esteemed" class="whisper">“But… But Slabal, even if my ilk do not see themselves incapable of chasing away the suffocation of the Crag spirit, then surely our doom will be borne upon our Minds; the ultimate, inescapable truth.  For all that we have strived for, all of the preparations that our forebears constructed, all is nought for now-”</p>
<p id="Slabal">“-I am also currently working on a plan to reconstruct the Ambon Aeternal;  While I understand that we do not have a great deal recovered yet, it is my understanding that while what the Bakshish, and to some degree, the Aggro have managed to recover of The Tome is not currently voluminous enough to fill those once massive halls, they evidently have so enough that storing it in faculty bookshelves and chests has become unwieldy.  It is the focal point of our goals for this season.”</p>
<p>It is not in your nature to interrupt someone while they are speaking… especially not Ledret.   She is The Esteemed, after all.  However, unfortunately, the simple truth is that you are finding yourself increasingly frustrated with her Doomsaying.  It seems almost as if she does not wish to be assured that her fears are misplaced.  Or perhaps they aren’t misplaced, but if nothing else, you can confidently state that her current modus for addressing such fears is counterproductive.  </p>
<p>She stares at you again… although, not truly seeing you, what with all that white buildup.  She seems shocked… and then, angry.  Darn.  Perhaps you should not have interrupted, after all.</p>
<p>-or, maybe, you should.  Strangely, now, her voice seems to have firmed up from the quavering tones they once adopted.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“I see.  So it is not that the Crag people are truly threatened by the outside, or by prior deprivation; in truth, the threat that lurks is one which lurks within, as it is just that the one who they hold to be their greatest Wisdom sees portents that mean nothing, imagines dangers without merit.  Is this the truth of it, Slabal?  Have you also seen how useless my singular talent has been to the Crag people?  How incomplete?  How <i>Infirm?</i>”</p>
<p>You wince.  You had not expected such language from her.  It looks like she’s not done yet, though.  With every passing sentence, however, the certainty, the surety of her voice, returns strong as ever.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“After all, what use is Portent without context?  In all things, I believe I can see the will of the gods, but have I finally become too far gone?  Gone beyond mere interpreter, to believe that in spite of all rational sight and thought, that I alone can see the True nature of their desires?  To know their <i>intentions</i>?  Do you truly think I have become so <i>Mad</i>? </p>
<p id="Esteemed">Tell me in Truth, Slabal!  Have my words become nought but surest <i>Insanity</i>?”</p>
<p>Well, that pretty much confirms what has been bothering her.  You can’t be certain, of course, but it always seemed to you that The Esteemed put a great deal of credence towards her gods, looking to them for guidance, and often giving them credit for what seemed to you to be, frankly, just sound judgement.  Sometimes.  Sometimes you’ll admit it seemed like unsound judgement, but then turned out for the better.  But is it insane?  That’s not really your area of expertise.  Again, you feel frustrated, for the question seems intended for Elpahka, or maybe even Bakshish ears, not Onagi.  What do you know of insanity?</p>
<p>But, she did ask, so…</p>
<p id="Slabal">“Yes.”</p>
<p>For some reason, she seems surprised at that answer.  You probably answered incorrectly.  While it’s not exactly your responsibility, maybe The Esteemed can help you understand where your reasoning falls apart.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“I can confidently state that I have no great understanding of it, so perhaps you can point out any inconsistencies in my knowledge.  But, insanity seems to be applied when a Crag is acting counter to rational behavior.  In this instance, I cannot understand the rationality of your relation to, and focus on, portents, Esteemed.  From what I have heard, it seems that if you have seen a portent correctly, and guide us so, then the gods are to thank.  Otherwise, if you cannot see a portent to avoid a threat, then you are to blame.  It seems a poorly structured system.  There is no room to recognize your particular contribution, and so no way to reinforce methodology or understand the method to avoid failure.  Indeed, it even seems to cloud the distinction between a portent you have received in earnest, and merely benefitting from the Wisdom that we recognize you and, well, Esteem you for.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems an irrational system, and to prefer it over one in which you apply your experience to known issues, or to anticipate future ones, thus allowing you to acknowledge your accomplishments as your own seems… Insane.” </p>
<p>She’s still just staring at you.  You wish, and not for the first time, that you were better at reading her expressions.  You can generally get them when she’s being overly emotional, but now, you’re at a loss.</p>
<p>Maybe, like some of your Tutors, she’s waiting for you to figure out your error on your own.  If so, you wish she’d give you a hint.  You’re not quite sure where to start.  Maybe a specific example would help her understand where you are having difficulty?</p>
<p id="Slabal">“I’m not sure if I can sight an error in my reasoning, so perhaps this might help to explain it.  Within this conversation, you have confided that  you believe that your… lifespan is coming to an end.  I do not know if I agree with that assessment, as while you are of advanced age, you are by no means as old as some of the oldest Crag I have seen recorded on the walls of some temples.  But, likely, you have better insight, due to portent.  However, if you are of this, I would assume you would be focusing your efforts upon the next logical step, rather than, well, despairing of your inability to spontaneously assess threats without any solid reasoning.”</p>
<p>That seems to spur something in her.  Her lips part, although, to your concern, her voice is weak again.</p>
<p id="Esteemed" class="whisper">“Next logical step?  Slabal, what could possibly be the next logical step to one’s Known End but to despair all they are incapable of doing?”</p>
<p>You aren’t sure if that’s a trick question.  You’ll assume it isn’t.  The Esteemed doesn’t do those as often as your Tutors did.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“To do what you are capable of doing?  It would seem more rational that such would spur you to craft instructions, or, more helpfully, to pass on your knowledge to the other Elpahka, to prepare them for your absence.  Even if you don’t believe you possess wisdom, then surely your skill in deciphering portent is worth passing.  The only reason to do...well… nothing but despair would be if you did not think yourself in possession of any skill or wisdom worth passing down… which also seems like Insanity.”</p>
<p id="Esteemed" class="whisper">“Why?” </p>
<p>The single word seems to carry a sentence’s worth of sorrow.</p>
<p id="Slabal">“...Because we are alive, Esteemed.  The Crag are here.  We exist, and in many ways, we thrive.  I do not think it reasonable to consider that possible, given the threats we know we faced, if you, our Heart, were as wholly incapable as you seem to think yourself.”</p>
<p>Once more, silence dominates the enclosed pagoda.  It stretches long, far longer than you really know how to address.  You aren’t sure if there’s anything further to say on the matter; you’ve pointed out your reasoning, cited examples… anything more would just be repeating yourself.  And, honestly, the silence seems preferable to hearing the Esteemed’s voice so… drained, as it is.  You can’t quite describe why it disheartens you so to hear it that way.  Perhaps it is just because it is unfamiliar.</p>
<p>But, after what seems to be minutes of silence, the Esteemed finally speaks once more.  To your relief, it possesses little trace of the earlier quavering. </p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Slabal, would you draw the curtains?”</p>
<p>And further relief, that’s a question that requires no answer.  You stand, and reach for the stone rings by which the first cloth panel is hung.  Removing it, you expose the Esteemed to Eschaton.  Of course, even with the curtain removed, she wouldn’t be able to see…</p>
<p>There is a brief flash of light, a crackle of ozone in the air.  When you look back towards the source of the noise, you can see the Esteemed with her hand against her face.  When she draws it back, her eyes, free of clouds, once more shine in the morning light.  A placid expression rests on her face, and she gazes upon Eschaton.  She breathes deeply of the unremarkable mountain air.</p>
<p>You move to remove the next panel, but are stopped short by her voice.</p>
<p id="Esteemed">“Your work is beautiful, Slabal.  Tell me, what is that structure’s purpose?”</p>
<p>Thank the ancestors.  Here are some questions you have no trouble answering.</p>
<hr>
<p>The thin scree slides ever so slightly beneath your feet as you pad your way down the slope.  Your eyes dart, left, right, left, over shoulder.  Your blood hums.  Your ears perk.  You see all, hear all.  The dipping sun, casting long shadows over the mountainside.  The soft whistle of the wind as it finds all the cracks and contours of this empty stretch.  The all-too-still boulders which rest so conveniently off to your right.  The almost imperceptible sound your pack macks as you unsling your bow.</p>
<p>And yet, in the midst of this moment, that pack brings something unbidden; memory, sour, bitter memory, of the accursed knowledge that was planted there so recently.  A scrap of parchment, so humble in appearance, but so deadly in promise.  The shame it carried.  The hate.  And worst of all, the indecision.</p>
<p>There is no time for that.  Not in this moment.  Better to focus on that which you have no trouble deciding.  Because now, in this very moment, is the time when Embebi must </p>
<p><i>DODGE</i></p>
<p>You hurl yourself to the side, rolling to a crouch as two thin whistles arc through the air you previously occupied.  The shots were well aimed; too bad the same could not be said for their hiding spot.</p>
<p>Laying in a crevice.  Crammed against a boulder.  Perfect for lying in wait.</p>
<p>Impossible to flee afterwards.</p>
<p>Your bow string hums, lobbing one, two missiles onto lazy but unerring trajectories.  You cannot wait to watch them strike, however; your head snaps back and forth for what comes next.  This time, it is the merest shift of a shadow that informs your next decision.</p>
<p>You fall flat backwards.  Your pack digs painfully into your spine as you slam into the ground, but the pain is a small price to see two more shafts shoot overhead. Firing from your back is always a difficult prospect, but one of your quarries has made it all too easy, full profile speeding towards nearby cover.</p>
<p>A better position, one that they <i>could</i> flee from.  Unfortunately, the distance is too great.  The smack of shaft against flesh greets your ears as you roll along the ground.  When you get to that fissure, you’ll be able to regain your posture, and-</p>
<p>Another pain, a sharper one, blossoms on your thigh just before you hit the fissure.  You glance down, hoping it was just a sharp rock, but the broken shaft nearby makes the source of the pain all too obvious.</p>
<p>Ah, shit.  Bastards got you good, this time.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>You roll to a stop on your front, just as you can hear a whoop coming from behind a dead shrub. </p>
<p id="olive">“Whoha! Cleanshot! Quarry confkill! YOSH!”</p>
<p>Heh.  You know you should probably clamp down on celebration like that, but fuckit.  Kid did good.  They really are showing fast progress.</p>
<p>You hop to your feet, brushing off the scree sticking to your jerkin.  Experimentally, you prod the area where the training arrow struck.  Whoof.  Say what you will about the Onagi, they make damn fine bows.  That one may even leave a bruise.</p>
<p>You take your time approaching the knot of celebrating Aggro.  Even though three of four look like they’ll sprout bruises of their own- aw crap, you hit that one kid in the face- each of them are still slapping eachother in celebration.  Good reason too; The first ones of this Clade to lay a blow on you, the extra ration of Craggoose is theirs tonight.  Of course, the center of attention is the one who actually landed the Cleanshot, Emmett.  You have a feeling that one will be going places.</p>
<p>Well, they’ve had their celebration.  Time to put them in their place.  A smirk crawls onto your lips.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“<i>Clade Theta Tertiary! Attend! Nullchat!</i>”</p>
<p>Well well, not a bad scramble to attention.  More points in their favor.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“First things come first, so congratulations, your goose is cooked.  But don’t let it go to your heads! Especially <i>you</i>, Emmett.  You might think you’re the new ristar around here, but don’t forget; if it weren’t for your Clade doing their part, you would have been toast.  Fourth hell, you probably would have been toast anyway! You landed the shot, but guess what?  You’re dead now!”</p>
<p>You point to the shrub he was using for concealment.  Not a bad position for that; obscures, lets you move away quickly, and if you’re a good enough shot, you can even fire through it.  It’s that second part, however, that needs to be emphasized. You hold up two fingers.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“It’s Shoot, then <i>Scoot</i>, Emmett, not ‘Shoot and then stand around like a fat target’!  Now, I see your strat; first shot missed, but you saw the opportunity for the second to get me while I was repos.  Good news, it worked; bad news, now my buddies have filled you with fresh new holes.  You just traded yourself for a nice, shiny scar on my leg.  Was it worth it, Emmett?”</p>
<p id="olive">“Against you, Stalkact?  Without question!”</p>
<p>Cocky little plop.  Too bad you can’t help but like that.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Allright, answer worth partial credit, porcupine.  Now fall in, artebe! You aren’t the last set of greenwoods I have to run through this test!”</p>
<p>Chortling to themselves, the quartet begin loping away back towards Eschaton.  For good measure, you give Emmett a maybe-slightly-too-friendly slap on the back as he goes.  You know it’s a good one; you can hear it echo.</p>

<p>...Echo.  Ancestors preserve, there’s another decision that you’ve been dodging.</p>
<p>You were a little concerned when he didn’t come back last season, but it never really crossed your mind that something could have happened to him down there.  Now?  Now you’re starting to actually worry.  It’s been nearly half a year, and still no sign.  There’s about three things you can think of that would prompt him to stay down their that long, and only one of them bodes any kind of well… for him, you mean, not for the Lowlanders. But the real problem with that decision?</p>
<p>Deciding to go find him, if he is still in one or at least several large pieces, effectively informs the <i>other</i> decision you’ve been avoiding.  And, frankly, not in a way that you would be at all happy with.  Whatever rationalization he might have justified to himself, you cannot shake the thought that whatever sick plan he was imagining would be… bad.  Let’s call it bad. You know it’s more than that, but you’ll leave it at Bad for now.</p>
<p>But, in a twisted way, making a decision on the <i>first</i> decision also informs that decision.  You have no doubt about how pissed Echo would be if he <i>does</i> make it back, only to discover that you’ve…</p>
<p>Call it what it is.</p>
<p>That you’ve declared war.</p>
<p>...Demons of three separate hells find inventive ways to molest you, the whole thing is a giant fuckin’ circle of… well… fuckin.  You.  The Aggro.  Maybe the Crag entirely.  Ancestors know that in spite of your rebound, plenty of Crag are still hurting from the Blight, and that was small time compared to the scars the Extermination have still left on your people.</p>
<p>And <i>that’s</i> why the only reasonable Decision… is to procrastinate.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the way you see it.</p>

<p>...But boy, does that give some <i>Pretty Damn Strong Motivation</i> to try and get more of the Specialist Aspects renewed…</p>
<hr>
<p>Fun fact; unless utilizing proper nouns, or a message exclusively using the longest words in the Elvish lexicon, a simple scrip, measuring 3 inch by 5 inch, can contain any message of 25 words or fewer, if both sides can be utilized.</p>
<p>Fun fact; both sides can be utilized.</p>
<p>Fun fact; this standardized system for recording messages results in one of the greatest densities of information-per-square-inch of papyrus used.</p>
<p>Unfun fact: While exceedingly efficient at storage, while stored, this method is extremely inefficient for actually referencing said scrips.</p>
<p>Unfun fact: Indeed, the most efficient method for such is actually to just spread them out over a large flat area, presenting the greatest area of displayed knowledge possible.</p>
<p>Unfun fact: That is why you don’t have a bed anymore.  Instead, it’s a secondary table.  The primary table is unavailable because it had to be used as a secondary desk.</p>
<p>Unfun fact: This is why you now rest in a chair.</p>
<p>Surprising fact: Somehow, the chair is more comfortable than your bed.  Who knew?</p>
<p>Boy, look at all those facts.  Given them, one is forced to conclude that you are none other than <b>The First</b>, and right now, you are living, eating, drinking, and breathing notescrips positively coated in information regarding Lowlander Genetics.</p>
<p>Of course, only about 90 of those (the ones displayed in reference section G(The secondary table(previously the bed))) are actual <i>responses</i> you’ve received so far;  the vast majority of them are past and, by greatest volume, future queries that are primed and ready for transmission, each and every day.  </p>
<p>To your immense surprise, however, combined with your already prodigious notes from your trip and, of course, your own incredibly deductive mind, it turns out that 2,213 words (while you respect your… colleague doesn’t sound right.  Informant? <i>Informant</i>, in the Lowlands, you must chide him on his inability to ensure every response has perfect utilization) <i>are</i> enough to reach some pretty groundbreaking conclusions.</p>
<p>TO WIT</p>
<ol>
    <li>While the Elves of the Lowlands <i>are</i> degenerated forms, they are not the worst-case-scenarios that some of the older scribes envisioned; it seems that regular conflict between their own kind (and some other intelligent life forms, supposedly) kept them from devolving into animalistic savagery.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, they demonstrate impressive… ‘genetic plasticity’ in regards to adapting to their environment… although, the reports from primary source muddle the specific reasons, as he continues to insist the Fires are like that due to ‘magic’.</li>
    <li>In spite of evident divergence in phenotype, there are(as of yet ‘unconfirmed’) reports that all of these phenotypes are still capable of… interbreeding.</li>
    <li>And thus, while this is <i>also</i> as of yet unconfirmed, this evidence of general compatibility strongly indicates that your theories regarding the Lowands as a… potential genetic reserve... hold merit!</li>
</ol>
<p>Not bad for half a year of research, if you do say so yourself, and you do say so yourself!  Probably what helps it significantly is the total lack of anyone else stepping on your heels; the sensitive nature of your investigations… maybe you should use some other word than sensitive… nevertheless, the nature requires the utmost secrecy, in order to avoid a panic; both moral, and the more mundane variety.</p>
<p>After all, if anyone else were to find out about you delving so deeply into the lore of Lowland genestreams, the uncomfortable question of <i>why</i> would arise…</p>
<p>Your thoughts are waylaid by a <i>welcome</i> interruption; the slight vibration, glow, and tone of the Feather which has been the center of your world for the past several weeks.  Eagerly, you move to the secondary desk, feather in one hand, pen in another, ink well (nearly dry, need to acquire more inkroot sap soon) at the ready, and a stack of blank scrip, ready to go!  And, just for good measure… </p>
<p>Reaching into the folds of your robes, you extract the stoppered vial of carefully prepared concoction; a potent formula known as <i>Essence of Faux Cunning</i>.  Knocking it back, you can feel your mind fortify, your insight sharpen; the perfect receptive state to understand <i>completely</i> all possible interpretations and deductions possible from a handful of sentences.  Mind prepared, concentrating on the item in hand, you will forth the message, and;</p>
<p class="Feather">“From Dust: We Anticipate coyote attack within couple seasons. Request all ally assistance. Can host logistics meeting at any time, or talk at potluck.  Thank you all.”</p>
<p>Your expression droops, and a tired sign wends its way past your lips.  <i>Again</i> with these “Coyote” Lowlanders.  Communications regarding them have been a recurring source of disappointment for you; More than once, your Informant, the admittedly estimable Fire known as The Hunger, has been forced to postpone his clarification messages to you in order to address issues regarding these riffraff.  While these violent kin to the other lowlanders may seem a vital concern to them, they serve as little more than an annoyance to you; after all, it’s not like they’ll ever threaten Eschato-</p>

<p>Something clicks in your mind.  By no means is this the first message you’ve heard of these brigands and their “horses”, but for some reason, the wording of this message reminds you of something.  In specific, the mention of the Potluck.</p>
<p>That would be coming up in a while, yes? It has to have been more than half a year since you were at the last one.  And yet, in addition to still apparently being a thorn in the side of the Lowlanders, these elves are apparently so mobile as to threaten <i>multiple</i> settlements of Lowlanders.  You don’t recall a ‘Dust’ as belonging to the Winged- you refuse to use the epithet ‘Flappy’, it just sounds undignified(which may actually be fitting, but neither here nor there)- and thinking on it, those mounts of theirs is likely much of the reason for their broad range.</p>
<p>A range which <i>might</i> just include your own path, should you try to make the trek into the Lowlands again next Summer.</p>

<p>Dammit.  In order to travel safely, you’ll probably need to request more than just a guide this time.  That means you’ll have to talk to Echoh wait a moment.  As far as you’ve heard, Echo hasn’t returned yet.  A sense of relief washes over you… only to then be matched by trepidation.  </p>
<p>Why <i>hasn’t</i> Echo returned?  You know his departure had something to do with the suggestion you made to Embebi, but you wouldn’t have imagined that either he or the Lowlanders would tolerate his presence longer than a few weeks.  You figured that probably, he’d end up murdering one of them in a fit of pique and would have stalked back home by now.  But since he hasn’t returned… maybe it’s because of those Coyotes?</p>
<p>On the surface of it, it seems ridiculous.  As much as you despise his brutish disposition and his… massive... hands… err, as much as those irritate you, would never have thought him to be one to fall to mere Lowlanders.  Even considering these Lowlanders to be a plausible threat, it seems an implausible theory.   And, quite honestly, not anything you should be theorizing about anyway.   Keeping track of threats and enemies is an Aggro concern, after all.  Surely, any theory you might have about his disappearance, they’ve already considered and either investigated or discarded.  While you are loathe to admit any gap in knowledge, the simple fact is that their exposure and experience with the ways of conflict does render them a better judge of action than you, a Bakshish.  And if they don’t consider these Coyotes to be a threat, you don’t see any reason you should.</p>

<p>...If they know the Coyotes are a threat. </p>
<p>Or even exist.</p>
<p>Now that you think about it, Embebi did not attend the Potluck- she had wandered off early on, long before the bulk of the discussion regarding the Coyotes.</p>
<p>You look down at the feather.  Ever since retrieving it from Slabal, you’ve ensured that it was placed to proper, <i>clandestine</i> use.  After all, for much the same reasons that the whole of your researches have been kept secret, if the Common Crag were to know that someone was within regular communication with the Lowlands… well, it would likely bode ill.</p>
<p>But that <i>also</i> means that, just as it was when in Slabal’s hands, some of its knowledge might not have gone to those who could use it best.</p>

<p>...It occurs to you, ever so briefly, that you might have fucked up.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s an exaggeration, for any number of reasons that you could name if it became actually relevant to name them.  The First Among Scholars doesn’t <i>fuck up</i>.  You may have just overlooked an opportunity or two.  And, while you’re not certain why said opportunities only occur to you now… possibly because of the tincture currently swirling through your veins… there is still ample opportunity to rectify that delay now.  </p>

<p>Now, how best to deliver the information so that it reaches someone who can act on it, obfuscates it’s source… after all, you are <i>still</i> somewhat uncertain about revealing the Feather’s existence… and, most importantly, ensures that any possible disaster that will, is, and possibly may have already occurred from how long this information was delayed doesn’t find it’s way back to you?</p>

<p>Well, that, at least, you have no trouble answering.</p>
<hr>
<p>It takes all of your willpower to avoid limping.  You’ve inspected the injury, you know it’s nothing serious, but fourth hell, it is annoying.  Still, there are appearances to be kept.  Besides, once you’re back inside the Gates of Eschaton (having actual <i>gates</i> again, how cool is that), you’ll just need to get to the Circle, debrief the Final clade, and call it a day; you can retreat to your room, and there you can wince and hobble to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>The thought of the <i>Final</i> clade weighs on you somewhat. Putting the would be… and, to no small amount of pride, definitely <i>will</i> be… Stalkers through the paces, Trialing them on ambush, cliffcraft, planning, and, your favorite, <i>execution</i>… it’s all been immensely fulfilling.  Honestly, more than you really expected it to be.  You never figured you’d have the chops as a Tutor… especially at this age, but that’s when happens when you don’t actually have any Stalkers who survived to become Senret.  And honestly, you probably still don’t, especially when it comes to the initial minutia and tedium of breaking and resetting half a life of imperfect habits.  But to see those youths grow and succeed… well, it’s inspiring in a way you’d never anticipate.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately, now that the last of them have passed your trials, it’s also a not-too-subtle reminder of the duties you’ve been shirking, the expeditions you’ve been neglecting… and, of course, the decisions you’ve procrastinated on.  Granted, you did have one more <i>excellent</i> excuse to avoid those; while this Winter is not nearly so harsh as the one before it, the lessons learned about how much more deadly the already perilous mountaintops can be in that clime are not soon to be forgotten.  Especially not when you know what awaits you in its dark recesses.</p>


<p>Standing within the Circle, briefing the youths on what is expected of them when they undergo the Rite of Distinction, the pain in your ankle continues to nag.  Steady, <b>Embebi</b>. The Rite is not a complicated one, and the Youths are picking up quick.  It’ll just be another few hours.</p>
<p>However, before you move on to the next part of the Rite, you’re interrupted by a pair of Aggro- Elekta and Romgor, you believe- and standing between them is… well, one of the most nondescript Crag you’ve ever seen.  You’d guess he’s a Bakshish, by his clothes and the smell of ink on him, but surprisingly broad for his Bloodline.  Or maybe it’s just the robes he’s wearing.</p>
<p>...he’s not saying anything.  He’s just sort of looking at you.  Or at the floor beneath you.  Or directly to your left.  </p>
<p>You look to his escorts, but don’t seem to have anymore clue than you do.  Finally, Elekta ends up elbowing him… which, at the relative heights, means she gets him right in the pectoral.  He does a bizarre little hop- high strung, you’d guess, and the dark pits under his eyes helps support that… but then finally clears his throat.  </p>
<p id="Drivel">“S-Stalker Embebi?”</p>
<p>Wow.  Somehow, he actually sounds more nervous than he looks.  You consider playing jest with him, but poor Crag looks like he’s under enough pressure already.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Aff, I.  You?”</p>
<p>He looks a little puzzled at that.  Crap, you should have kept it civil.  Force of habit.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Yes, I am Embebi.  And you are?”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Oh! Uh, apologies.  I am Drivel, Fourth School, of the Study of Lowland Esoterica.  I was instructed to meet with you.” </p>
<p>He reaches carefully into his satchel, and draws forth a scroll in slightly trembling hands.  First hell, what’s up with him?  He hands you the roll of parchment, then coughs into his hand.  You glance at it; it looks as though it’s sealed with hivewax, but there’s no marking upon the seal. You look back to him, managing to catch his eyes, which then immediately look away.</p>
<p>Something about this doesn’t seem right.  You wouldn’t consider yourself amazing at reading people, but this Crag is way too nervous for something like this… unless maybe that wasn’t the first time Elekta gave him a thump.  She’s like that, sometimes.  Not one to use words when limbs will do.  Still, you can’t help but be curious.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Thank you, Drivel.  And… what is this, exactly?”</p>
<p>He swallows, and his eyes focus on the distance.  Then, he begins rattling off an explanation.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“ ‘Stalker Embebi, the Study of Lowland Esoterica wishes to pass along a number of observations and discoveries that have been drawn naturally in the due course of information gathered by those who have travelled into the Lowlands as well as numerous other deductions that have been drawn by traditional lore and common observation and reason  while it is by and large a series of theories it was deemed most appropriate that they should be given to you so as to attempt to aid the Aggro in their appointed tasks through the dispersal of Knowledge as is well and right in the Responsibility of the Bakshish bloodline  I advise that you take the time to read and consider these observations fully.‘ ” </p>
<p>...You’re pretty sure that should have been more than one sentence.  Impressive lung capacity, though.  Still, something about this seems off.  You glance back at the scroll.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Observations on the Lowlands, aff?  Might be interesting.  Why the seal, though?”</p>
<p>His lips form a tight line.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Uhh… it was believed that the contents might be of a… disturbing nature to most Crag, as it is regarding the savage Lowlands, and that... precautions should be taken for the sake of… the common good?”</p>
<p>You cock an eyebrow.  That sounds like a pretty excessive dose of paranoia.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“The First sent this, quiaff?”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Wh-What?! But-”</p>
<p id="Embebi">“<i>Crap</i>, sorry.  ‘The First sent this, correct?’ That’s what I meant to say.”</p>
<p id="Drivel">“Well.. I… He...”</p>
<p>Okay, that tells you everything you need to know.  Time to let the poor Crag out of the net.  </p>
<p id="Embebi">“<i>Relax</i>, Scholar Drivel.  I’m sure there was good reason to obfuscate that.  No idea what it is yet, but hey, maybe the contents will clue me in, quiaff?  Err, Right?”</p>
<p>He doesn’t say anything in return, but his expression… oh yeah.  That tells you pretty much everything you need to know. </p>
<p id="Embebi">“Right.  Well, was there anything else?”</p>
<p>It looks like he’s just going to remain silent for a moment, but just before you speak, he pipes up.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“You’ve actually been down there, Stalker Embebi?  In the Lowlands?”</p>
<p>...You’re kind of surprised he doesn’t know that, but you guess The First hasn’t talked much about the trek to the Potluck.  Not very open, that Crag.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Aff. <i>Dam-</i> Yes.”</p>
<p>Somehow, he seems to muster up the courage to actually look you in the eyes this time.  Huh.  He’s got the same eye color you do.</p>
<p id="Drivel">“...Does it haunt you?”</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“Well…”</p>
<p>You think back to the plains.  Those vast, open stretches.  Skyline broken only by the occasional tree and the mountains which dominate the horizon.</p>
<p>You think to the forests.  The endless susurration of life, the smell of decaying wood, the wisps of wind that find their way through the thickets.</p>
<p>You recall the swamps, moist, impenetrable, shrouding every threat, a surprise waiting in every pond.</p>
<p>And, through it all, you are reminded of where you are now.  Enclosed.  Surrounded by dead walls. Enclosed from the Sky.  The constant presence of other people, always watching, from every angle.</p>
<p id="Embebi">“...Yes.  It does.”</p>
<p>It’s the answer he expects.  The one his escorts expect.  The one that is true.  Just not in the way he meant.</p>

<p>As they take him back to the entrance, you tuck the scroll under your arm.  You’ll get to whatever the First wants to ramble on later.  First things Later, Rite things Now.  Only a couple more hours.</p>


<p>Somewhat anticlimactically, by the time you actually make it back to your room, your sprain or whatever it was has stopped hurting entirely.  Sort of takes the fun out of lazing about like this.  Nevertheless, you promised it to yourself, and that’s one promise you plan on keeping.</p>
<p>And then there’s the matter of this oh-so important scroll.  May as well; it’s not like <i>not</i> reading it will get back at the First for making ...Drivel?  Pretty sure that’s right... act as an anonymous tip for no sane reason you can imagine.  Besides, paranoid as he can be… he’s also right, a lot of the time.  You break the seal with your thumb, unfurl the document, and start reading.</p>

<p>And then read.</p>

<p>And then read the rest.</p>

<p>And then reread the first part.</p>

<p>And then, you begin to panic, just a little.</p>

<p><i>Coyote</i> elves.  You know what a Coyote is.  You saw them while in the lowlands.  At first, you mistook it for a Wolf.</p>
<p>Now, you wonder if the Lowlanders have mistaken a Wolf for a Coyote.</p>
<p>They ride mounts… the details on these ‘horse’ are somewhat sparse, but you can see how it might be a special name.  Or maybe, it’s a different mount, just more suited for the Lowlands?</p>
<p>But in any case, you can read between the lines.  They are hostile to the other elves.  Almost cruelly so.  They’ve killed some, stolen from others, and have even managed to kidnap one or more, holding them in bondage.  </p>
<p>Such barbarism… sounds familiar.</p>

<p>You might be mistaken.  It’s possible that two completely separate bands of hostile, aggressive elves who ride mounts and took canine names exist.  But if what you suspect may be true… then your decision may be even bigger than you imagined.</p>
<p>… Or, to look at it from another angle… it may already be decided?</p>
<p>It seems clear that the other Lowlander elves… the Blades, the Fires, the Rivers, so on… oppose these murderous kin.  In that case, isn’t War already effectively declared?</p>
<p>Of course, that supposes you considering the Crag to be one of them…</p>

<p>But, in any case, whatever this may truly mean, it does throw your current decision into perspective.  Whether a single great threat, or merely two <i>big</i> threats, the Aggro are not currently ready for an engagement of this scale.  Too little time has passed, too little recovery has happened. </p>
<p> Yet, neither can you accept their existence. They are a threat to both you and the Lowlanders… and, frankly, you’re starting to think that they may not be as insane as they first appeared.  </p>
<p>So, only one option really remains.</p>
<p><i>Procrastination.</i></p>
<p>But this time, with a specific purpose.</p>
<p>No wind can penetrate into your bedroom, but if it could, then probably, it would contain a Promise of Strife.</p>

<h2>Skill Usage</h2>
<p><b>Economic:</b> <i>Body, and Soul.  So far, The Layer’s efforts to see to the needs of the People of Eschaton have been successful, but now, she faces a trial greater than solid halls, stone walls, and higher calls.  She faces Academia.  Though one of the least populous of the Crag Bloodlines, the Bakshish are still vital to the operation of Crag Society; the collected knowledge, the detailed inventories, and the meticulous plans that they create are essential to ensure survival in such an unwelcoming environment.  However, while in all her previous endeavors, those she sought to aid were in agreement to what was most needed, among the Bakshish she may ask five scholars what will aid their kind most, and receive seven answers.  Frustrating and contradictory, she appreciates that a counterpoint exists to their wild speculation; the calming presence of the reinvigorated Elpahka, who see through the Studies immediate needs to envision what will serve today, tomorrow, and until time unknown.  Through these new and renovated halls of learning, the Bakshish may be able to improve their attempts to understand the world, and all the mechanisms inside it… or may just continue arguing circlicly in support of their personal agendas.</i></p>
<p><i>Frankly, whatever the means, Slabal's just glad someone signed off on something.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Infrastructure(Enrichment)</b> Skill to replace the aspect Cast the Third Stone: Belonging with the aspect Cast the Fourth Stone: Esteem.  Few other Bloodlines are as concerned with status and recognition as the Bakshish, and for good reason, as it is only through rigorous testing and constant challenge that knowledge can be truly refined.  To reign in these competing views into a cohesive whole, however, requires an outside viewpoint, one which the Elpahka are bound and trained to provide.  Through them, Slabal can Invoke the Aspect Cast the Third Stone: Belonging to provide an extra proficiency die to this check.</p>
<p>But, this Winter, Slabal is not the only Onagi who seeks to better the lot of the Crag people.  Eparchy, though still few in population, has become inordinately full of resources, and now, as the Cold Season descends once more, the time is ideal to shape the stones, lay the paths, and prepare for a grander tomorrow.  Eparchy must Swell.</p>
<p>Entrusted with the future of this new settlement, Entrep knows that now is the time to put The Layer’s long term plans into action.  Having studiously prepared and carefully waited for the ideal time, she uses a Fate point to Motivate the Aspect Our Legacy is Set In Stone, allowing her to use the <b>Infrastructure(Establishment)</b> Skill to grow Eparchy into the next size of settlement.</p>

<p><b>Political:</b> <i>Few can understand what has plagued the mind and soul of The Esteemed this year.  Furthering the mystery is her now- apparent recovery from this deep fugue, as once more she admits members of the Wisdom and the Elpahka to petition her for wisdom.  Curiously, however, in all things, one answer seems to become prevalent; Beware.  Rather than a portent of doom, however, it has become a practical call; many of the basic elements of life in Eschaton, though stable for now, still rest within a moment’s notice of potential disaster.  Everywhere, the Mantra goes forth: Prepare for the Worst.  Though a concerning message, few can doubt the foundation of Wisdom beneath it.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Recovery(Rebuilding)</b> Skill to move 0 points of stress from the Morale track and place it on the Property track, removing 0 points of stress in the process.  Though this is again of little specific merit, it best represents The Esteemed’s attempts to put her portents of doom to some practical use.  </p>

<p><b>Military:</b> <i>Though last season’s growth of the Stalkers was merely opportunity, the threats that Eschaton, and possibly all of Elvenkind, now face make it clear that simply waiting for opportunity is insufficient.  Unfortunately, while Embebi recognizes that this means that the Aggro must advance beyond a simple default training, and be pushed to fill the Aspects which once defined their military capability… she, personally, only really knows how to train Stalkers.  But when all you have is a bow…</i></p>
<p><i>To this end, although the first round of Talcsome Stalkers were pulled from those with obvious aptitude and capability for the art, now she must actively seek those who would not consider the Aspect before, sussing out the ability that even they, themselves, may not be aware of.</i></p>
<p>Attempting to use the <b>Military Science(Drill)</b> Skill to add another unit of Talcsom Stalkers to the Division Vigor of Youth.</p>

<p><b>Mental:</b> <i>The First’s mad quest for knowledge… okay, more obsessive than really mad, as he does have an end goal, but still… now begins to take concrete form.  The information he has gleaned about the Lowlands is more than sufficient for him to believe that Lowland populations are a… viable source of diversity, to continue using euphemisms.  Now, with that knowledge at hand, and the previously established understanding of the Crag’s own bottleneck… time to see if a, for lack of a better term, ‘plan of action’ can be established.  While more would obviously be better, there has to be a specifically determined cutoff of the minimum number and mixture of Lowland Phenotypes whose introduction could resolve the Crag’s stagnation.  While he still hasn’t even begun to address how, precisely, such would be actually acquired, he thinks it’s probably easier to figure out the what than the how, for now.</i>  </p>
<p>Utilizing the <b>Academics(Research)</b> Skill to attempt to conjoin the gathered knowledge of Lowland Phenotypes with that of the Crag’s Bloodlines to derive the Minimum Viable Population of Phenotypes, and their numbers, which would be necessary to introduce into the upcoming Next Generation in order to resolve the Bottleneck, at least for the near future.  Success on this check will complete the first half of the Solution The Lowland Ilk; The second half, actually executing such a plan, will be the subject of later research.  For now, however, he will use the Upgrade granted him by his tireless research on this check.</p>

<p>End of Turn </p>
<p>Results-</p>
<p><b>Economic-</b> The Onagi are the pride of the Crag.</p>
<p>Eschaton is slowly returning to its former glory, but the Bakshish prove a challenge for Slabal. For she can handle any number of engineering challenges, but a flock of arguing and debating scholars proves almost overwhelming.</p>

<p>Thankfully before Slabal is completely buried in a four hour argument over which study needs more archive versus desktop space, the Elpahka step in. They are able to manage the testy academics into giving Slabal the one thing she needs: An actual coherent plan.</p>

<p>Once Slabal has her objective laid out in front of her and a clear goal in mind, Slabal does what Slabal does: delivers what she promised, on time and under budget. Slabal has been so routinely delivering breathtaking works of architecture that she makes such incredible work seem mundane. It's really quite impressive.</p>

<p>In Eparchy, her skills at delegation also prove worthwhile. The team she left behind complete her plans exactly the way she would have: using exactly the amount of resources and taking exactly the same amount of time as promised. Eparchy has successfully grown to Village size, but something else interesting happens…</p>

<p>In the process of organizing and expanding the iron ore production, the teams of excavators find something interesting. The old sword had been right. The quality of iron ore found in Eparchy is of exceptional quality. With the increased elfpower available, they now have the ability to fully refine that ore and deliver shipments of ore with unmatched purity.</p>

<p>The Pumping Iron Aspect has been improved to Pumping Iron: Impressive Gains. Any usage of this Aspect or a traded version of this Aspect to create steel materials of any kind will provide an automatic advantage on top of any other bonuses that the Aspect provides.</p>

<p><b>Political-</b> At first, it seems like there is nothing for the Esteemed to really do here. There's no crisis that requires the hard decisions of rationing and determining need that she is so talented at. All is well, and everyone is stable. Sure, supplies are lower than people would like, but she can't conjure materials or resources out of thin air. In fact, it would be easy for the Esteemed to seem like a mad woman, walking from home to home telling people they're doomed, doomed I say!</p>

<p>The Ledret of the last couple seasons might have done that. This time, she earns her title. She moves from caste to caste, home to home, and simply… talks.</p>

<p>She talks to people about how they survived the war. She talks to Aggro about the sibs they lost. She talks to the lowland refugees about their time hiding in fear to escape Extermination. She talks to the Samra about their desperate struggle to keep everyone fed despite impossible quotas. She talks to Bakshish about the terrible burden of the loss of their very core Responsibility and the deep sense of failure that exists among them. She talks to the Onagi about the bitter ache caused by having to tear down the very structures their ancestors spent their lives maintaining. All of this and more, the Esteemed talks to her people about.</p>

<p>In doing so, Ledret discovers the last key resource on which the Crag are critically low: Trust.</p>

<p>Not just trust in her, but trust in the other Named, trust in the Path. Trust in the other Crag around them. Trust that the very Crag way of life is possible, if not life as they know it at all. Without that kind of trust, society is impossible.</p>

<p>By talking Crag through their worst experiences in recent memory, Ledret is able to slowly able to rebuild that trust, or at least start it healing. Finally talking about what happened, the Crag begin to think about how they could be prepared if something like that happens again. The Crag now know that the Esteemed truly does understand how bad things got. If she has fears, they are reasonable. If she says prepare, prepare. Bad times will come again. Ledret reminds everyone that preparing for that is the responsibility of all Crag.</p>

<p>Despite these sweeping motivations, there just aren't enough resources for major prepping. Still, even the most humble Samra is able to make sure they keep a little extra supply of food and water. These preps, spread out among all Crag households, will provide a boost die on your next Recovery effort.</p>

<p>More important than that, though: Ledret's actions have declared something important about the future of the Crag. Whatever comes next, her people Trust her again.</p>

<p>Now, if only she could trust herself...</p>

<p><b>Military-</b> Embebi immediately runs into the extremely depressing reality that there just flat out aren't that many young Aggro left. Yeah, that's not encouraging considering what she's got on her mind. Still, she has far from exhausted all possibilities, and she did get some recruits! Not enough for a full square, but some.</p>

<p>Plus, there's all those refugees who survived the lowlands. Even if they're not Aggro by temperament, a decade or so of surviving in that chaotic environment might force someone to develop the skills of a Stalker…</p>

<p>Whatever Embebi decides to do next, she will receive a boost die on her next check to recruit more talcsome.</p>

<p><b>Mental-</b> First is running out of fucking parchment. Cataloging the dizzying variety of traits that lowlanders have, much less how they all interact, is a startling amount of busywork. It's tedious and repetitive, even by his standards, and he has to move so slow, 25 words at a time. Some of these lowlanders don't even track their traits… they just kind of… have them. How perverse. </p>

<p>Still, while First's research is not complete, he makes measurable progress. It's just more number crunching than he initially expected. He will have a boost die on his next check to continue this research. </p>

<p>--------------</p>
<p>You are <b>Ledret</b>, and you are receiving a vision.</p>

<p>Though “vision” is kind of a poor term for what’s happening. You can’t see shit.</p>

<p>Your vision is dim and crowded with cataracts. You can scarcely see inches in front of you. You can feel more than see the Path beneath you. It is crumbling. Ancient stone, weathered and weak. Cracking and turning to dust. Coming to an end. You drop to your knees and feel the weary stones beneath you. You timidly feel your way forward, an inch at a time, convinced you will feel the nameless abyss at the end of your Path and moment now.</p>

<p><i>Clack.</i></p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><i>Clack.</i></p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p><i>Clack.</i></p>

<p>The odd noise rouses you. You raise your head and point towards it. Your vision clears slightly. The cloudy darkness recedes just a few more feet. There, on a Path parallel to yours, is Slabal. Good, reliable, dependable Slabal.</p>

<p>She is laying a Path at her feet. True to Slabal, it is perfect in every way. Every stone fits just so with the others. It is a solid, stable Path that can carry a great deal of weight. As you watch, Slabal is very carefully measuring and laying her Path. She moves forward one stone at a time.</p>

<p>Measure, divot divot. Measure, divot divot. Measure, divot divot. Another stone <i>clacks</i> into place, just as perfect as the last. Slabal continues, her head down and wilfully ignorant of the world. She builds her Path, perfect in every way, except for the fact that she’s chosen to run it right alongside yours.</p>

<p>You turn back to your own Path. Surprisingly, it stretches to the end of your still limited vision. Yes, the edges are crumbling away, and yes cracks are forming, but the center is still strong. It is not yet at its end. You glance back at Slabal. Dutifully, unquestioningly, her path follows yours. You can’t just expect it to end. You have to know.</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, you begin to walk forwards. Your Path continues. It does not veer off into the abyss, at least not right away. You begin to come to your senses, and your vision clears more.</p>

<p>In the cloudy darkness, you can see other shapes. Other elves, moving along their Path. Close to you, you can see Embebi. She slowly moves along an unstable, inclined patch of scree. Her bow is in her hands, her eyes scanning for threats. Carefully, cautiously, she moves forward one step at a time, careful not to slip on the treacherous ground. She stays steady, but moves slowly forward.</p>

<p>You see Echo of Blood. He is not moving carefully and slowly. His path is not perfectly fit together. Echo angrily grabs stones and rocks from the air and slams them into the path beneath him. He tries desperately to build his Path in some direction, any direction. The hastily built and unstable Path creaks and groans under his massive weight. He doesn’t care. He moves forward erratically.</p>

<p>You continue to walk your path. Your vision continues to clear. Your path twists and turns, upwards and downwards, in loops and arcs you don’t understand. It does, however, stay solid. You continue to follow it. You have no other choice.</p>

<p>You pause as a strip of fresh snowfall cross your Path. You pause and look at it. There are narrow lupine pawprints in the snow. You follow them with your eyes. A narrow Path made of snow twists away from yours, towards darkness. In the distance, at the edge of your vision, you see the white wolf. The Seeker’s head is down, her shoulders hunched. The wolf moves as if it is trying to push against a powerful wind. She glances back and gives you a look as enigmatic as the last. She then turns her head back and moves on. She presses forward, but only with great effort and cannot see where she is going.</p>

<p>You keep walking your Path. Your vision continues to clear. You see elves you do not recognize.</p>

<p>You see a river twisting near the snow. It is deep and powerful. You see a dark blob moving just beneath the surface, elven in shape and green. It dives deeper in its Path. Red blood boils to the surface. She swims forward with blood clouding her vision.</p>

<p>You see an elf with wings. She rides a powerful current of wind that moves her in twists and dives that are beautiful but chaotic. Her eyes are focused upwards, on something far above that you cannot see. She moves forward heedlessly, unable to see where she is being carried by the wind.</p>

<p>You see a short elf with pale skin. She walks a Path that is sturdy and well made, nearly so well as Slabal’s. Despite the quality of her Path, her eyes are closed. She moves forward cautiously, terrified to open her eyes and see that her Path is wanting.</p>

<p>You see an elf in a mask. He crawls on his hands and knees. His Path is made of cinders and ash, slowly cooling beneath him. The ashes are disintegrating, blowing away on the wind. He moves desperately, clinging to every withering clump of ash, determined to move forward just. one. more. inch.</p>

<p>You see a tall elf, dressed in colorful robes. He moves forward on a Path made of shifting sand. He carries many shapes behind him, some quite different from his own. As the sands twist and slither beneath him, he steps with cool calculating eyes. He moves forward with mindfulness and care, for those who he carries with him.</p>

<p>You see a Path made of darkness, so pitch black it’s darker than the abyss around it. It is narrow as a tightrope. Just barely, you can make out a gaunt figure walking the Path. His black eyes are fixated on the rope. Every step is made with fear and carefulness. He moves forward, ever aware of the endless abyss clawing at him.</p>

<p>You see an old elf walk a Path made of polished steel. He moves on his knees. Every few inches, he stops. He carves more names into the Path, then continues only to stop again. He moves forward weighed down by the immeasurable guilt he carries.</p>

<p>You see a path made of fresh laid red bricks. They are stained with even redder blood, and marred by blackened scorch marks. An elf staggers along the path, wounded perhaps mortally. She moves in staggering painful jerks, heedless of the injury, somehow still standing, carried forward only by her will to not fall quite yet.</p>

<p>As the clouds lift from your vision, you can see all of these Paths and more twisting and turning through the void around you. You watch as they twist together, coming towards a point somewhere ahead of you. As the Paths wind towards each other, there is sudden chaos.</p>

<p>The Paths slam into each other. There is an explosion. Paths are erased, elves die. The paths twist around each other, somehow avoiding conflict. The paths combine, working towards a common goal. The Paths smash together, forever dooming them all to crumble. All this and more happens in an instant, and yet none of it does. It is a jumbled mass of potential, a spider web of causality. It is a crisis point, and you are very close to it.</p>

<p>They are all in great danger, you realize, but not just from each other. There’s something more.</p>

<p>That familiar creeping sensation returns. That there is something missing. That there is something wrong. That incredible danger exists just beyond your awareness. You take a deep breath and extend your senses. Like you haven’t done in such a long time, you forget your fears and your ego. Only an empty vessel into which sensation enters, you watch and you listen.</p>

<p>You see them.</p>

<p>Eyes. Pairs of yellow eyes, looming in the abyss. Dozens of them. No, hundreds. Watching you on your Path, watching the other elves, even watching the Seeker. They are cruel. Predatory. Hungry.</p>

<p>Suddenly, your senses alert to the danger. Oh gods, they’re all going to die. You are aware of things you were not mere moments ago. How can they not see it!?</p>

<p>How can Echo not see the waiting jaws just beneath his unstable Path? How can the Seeker not see the half dozen black shapes stalking her? How can Embebi not feel the hot breath from the sharp-fanged grin inches behind her neck? How can the masked man not see the vicious teeth slowly closing around him? What are they all doing?</p>

<p>With that, you realize something. One of the pairs of eyes is watching you. Yellow and ruthless, they know where you are. They are closer than the others, but are not yet moving towards you. You are in grave danger too, but you have a little time left still.</p>

<p>You look to your Path. It continues forward, not yet at an end. Old and weathered, yes, but not yet broken.</p>

<p>As you watch it, you see your Path branch in two directions. One trails off into the void, ever more narrow and crumbling, ever more irrelevant. One leads directly into the heart of the crisis point. You have no idea what happens to it there. The yellow eyes watch you.</p>

<p>You think you know what to do. You begin to walk forward. You choose a path. Your fingers brush against  something.</p>

<p>You pull aside the curtain and step out onto the balcony at your pagoda.</p>

<p>The world stretches out beneath you. In that odd way of dreams, you can see forever. Your vision is remarkably clear and sharp. You can see the ocean to the south and the desert beyond it, the jungles at the base of the mountains, the looming caldera, and the crisscrossing rivers and slowly growing cities of the lowlander elves. It is a sight at once stunningly beautiful and overwhelmingly frightening.</p>

<p>As you sit and watch, you hear a voice. It comes from the rocks around you. It whistles through the mountains behind you. It rises from every nook and cranny of the lowlands beneath you, from the cities and tunnels and rivers. It is thousands of voices, all elves, all speaking at once. Some familiar, some alien, but all part of a single entity. It is at once stunningly awesome and comfortingly intimate.</p>

<p>The voice speaks,</p>
<p><i>Oh, Ledret, I am so sorry</i></p>
<p><i>I know you don’t know me</i></p>
<p><i>But I know you</i></p>
<p><i>I know it hurts.</i></p>
<p><i>I know your bones ache and your body protests</i></p>
<p><i>I know your heart tightens and your soul is weary</i></p>
<p><i>I know you are so very afraid and so very full of doubt</i></p>
<p><i>I know you question yourself so much</i></p>
<p><i>But oh, Ledret, if only you could see yourself like I see you</i></p>
<p><i>I am so very Proud of you</i></p>
<p><i>Ledret, please don’t give up</i></p>
<p><i>I know you have come so very far</i></p>
<p><i>I know it hurts so much to continue</i></p>
<p><i>But please don’t give up</i></p>
<p><i>They need you</i></p>
<p><i>They all need you.</i></p>
