    <p>A bit concerned about their general academic capabilities, Smilisca quietly takes the yearly skill point and puts it in Academics.  Litoria does not complain, for she has already declared the Coyote War upgrade as having gone into Military Science.  Staurois is certain that the people who have received the delegation of responsibility are acting in good faith and he trusts their choices well enough to not overrule them.</p>
    <p>Allophryne follows Bryti to Surt.  He’s most definitely not ready to do the Afflicted Purifier job on his own yet, so she’s stuck with the tail for now.</p>
    <h3 id="jump">Roleplay Event 4.1.1: <a href="../Bonus/12_Ambush Predators.php">Ambush Predators</a></h3>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> As planned, Partager follows the river up through the canyons to Asavardi.  Trade attempts occur.  Partager requests copper, exotic timber, or cash in exchange for the construction krewes’ assistance with a large scale project Asavardi has planned.  They roll up to the edge of town to best apply their stunt, Elf Express, and allow their winged elf trading partners to multitask.</p>
    <p>Attempting to trade with the flappy flaps uses the <i>Merchants</i> trapping of <b>Trade</b> and rolls 2 Ability dice and 1 Proficiency die: 2 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs This is ultra shitty.  Staurois spends a Fate point to try and fix it.  Reroll: 2 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Guess what?  We’re looking for spies.  For the first time in the recorded history of this local area, nobody’s worried about sea elves.  Wolf Elves have everyone’s full attention.  This action uses the <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> and rolls 2 Ability dice: 3 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Military: </b>With the discovery of the hippo bones, Arpenter has found their mission.  They are hunting for hippos.  Domestication is a long process, but with some luck, a lot of foresight, and careful training programs it can be done again.  It worked on the Western coast.  Surely, East Coast hippos will be just as successful.</p>
    <p>The Pathfinders traveling with the Crafty Crawfish spring into action and thoroughly scour the branch of the river that the swiftly-moving flotilla follows.  They attempt to scout the three indicated squares near Arpenter.  They use the <i>Pathfinders</i> trapping of <b>Reconnaissance</b> and roll 2 Ability dice: 2 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Still short on supplies for magical research, Smilisca and Staurois instead put their heads together to work on the problem that is Government.  Staurois pulls from historic records of how the multitude of flotilla were organized under a central leadership before the arrival of their first Skati.  Smilisca charts the math necessary for how to implement these concepts on the much smaller scale they have to work with on this Eastern coast.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to Assign individuals to their best suited responsibilities when most everyone knows each other, even if just by reputation.  Staurois cautions that this will become harder as their numbers multiply.  They work toward learning what options might work for their situation where settlements may not always be able to contact each other easily.  This uses the <i>Research</i> trapping of <b>Academics</b> and rolls 2 Ability dice: 0 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Arpenter</b> has a very, very interesting season. The river they set themselves on tracks through the northern edge of the badlands. It is a difficult journey to say the least, but the swift Brightwood rafts make it possible. What they find when they reach the northern end of the river is shocking.</p>
    <p>Ankkharavathyr the Magnificent himself lands on Arpenter. The flotilla is quite surprised by his arrival as he politely informs them that they have entered his domain. Prosalirus, the Oarmaster for this flotilla, manages to keep the situation positive. His formal way of speaking and dedication to etiquette and protocol impress the dragon. Ankkharavathyr ends up quite interested in the idea of future trade. While Fool's Fortune was a terrible attempt at a gold mine, it turns out that the previous owners had missed out on something really important: deeper in the mine, far under the mountain, there is a rich vein of Mithral. There's also a bunch of gemstones, but Ankkh finds those delicious and doesn't really want to part with them.</p>
    <p>The Mithral however, well, it's not really his favorite flavor. He loves economics and wants to see what the wider elven world has to offer, and just might start by trading with Arpenter. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Arpenter is kind of light on valuable trade goods at the moment. If you want to trade for some Mithral, it's going to be a hard sell. You do have some spare Brightwood meant to be an emergency supply, or you could even trade someone's raft in a pinch. They can get paid back. You do also have plenty of lagniappe. Arpenter's food supplies are strong, and you have plenty of spices and examples of river elf craftselfship.</p>
    <p>Mithral is extremely valuable, however. Trading for a usable amount of Mithral will be difficult, especially since you don't have an established relationship with Ankkh.</p>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Trade with the Winged Elves goes swimmingly (which, now that I think about it, is probably a river elf saying.) The Winged Elves were extremely enthusiastic about a project they've been planning for some time: The addition of large scale cargo lifts to Asavardi.</p>
    <p>Given how hard it is to get anything up those sheer cliffs, you can see why. Asavardi is still a relatively small settlement, with goods being delivered largely by cargo net or even individual couriers. For the settlement to grow, they're going to need to move a lot more goods.</p>
    <p>They seem to have realized this. They did in fact have fairly good plans for how to implement a lift system, having cleared out suitable locations and even done some planning for how goods will move around the settlement. They also gathered a large amount of lumber, rope, and other raw materials needed to create the lift.</p>
    <p>In the end, most of what they need is the use of the raft, some help tweaking the designs, most notably how to power it. Winged elves ain't beefy like river elves, they don't have many strong work animals, and the river is a bit narrow and unpredictable for water wheels to provide all the energy. In the end, it takes clever ideas from both winged and river elves to solve it.</p>
    <p>Wind flows, just as water does, and through the narrow canyons of Asavardi, wind flows fast and strong. A winged elf ponders if a wheel could capture the motion of the wind, same as water. The idea takes some tweaking, but by making wide cloth sails instead of paddles, the concept works. Initially, it's not enough power to work a lift, but a river elf who worked on siege engines has the idea to store the power in twisted ropes like a ballista. It's not a perfect system - a few water wheels provide energy too, and sometimes people have to use muscle power if it is very busy or the wind is slow - but it does work, and it's rather ingenious.</p>
    <p>The winged elves, being winged elves, quickly use brightly colored fabrics and paints to make the windwheels now dotting Asavardi pretty to look at. With that, it's done.</p>
    <p>The first major shipment made with the cargo lifts is depositing a large Copper Shipment as payment for your efforts. The second is a shipment of river elves who spend a night or two celebrating in Asavardi. It goes very well. No one even falls off.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Your Eyes note nothing out of the ordinary - that is, until guards at Partager get an eyeful of someone literally jumping off a cliff in Asavardi in the middle of the night, pursued by flappies. Whoever it is appears to slam back a potion of Feather Fall moments before they hit the ground and tear off into the rough shrubbery along the cliff face.</p>
    <p>Your Eyes scramble to help the winged elves search for the spy, but he manages to slip away in the dark. The winged elves give you a brief summary of what happened. Their protective ward went off, but by the time they were able to find the spy, he had already managed to gather whatever info he came here for - apparently he was focusing on information gleaned from flappy mail.</p>
    <p>The good news is that they were able to hit the spy with a dispel, taking out their river elf disguise. The spy was unquestionably a wolf elf, and they get a good physical description to boot.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, the wolf elves didn't make it to the flotilla. At worst, some info about your trade routes was compromised. Major secrets like the location of Winter Quarters and the stats of your wolf are safe.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> Traversing the Badlands is tough enough, even with a river to follow. The Pathfinders and scouts attached to Arpenter are forced to spend most of their time gathering food for the flotilla and otherwise ensure it can safely make the journey, leaving little time for charting everything they planned.</p>
    <p>When Arpenter reaches the end of the river, however, they finally have some time. They are able to scout one territory. Unfortunately, it's not so hot for hippos. This territory has Badlands and River Aspects, meaning it definitely doesn't have the level of plant life needed to sustain a stable population of hippos. Any hippo population would have to be further east.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Interestingly, Smilisca and Staurois both turn up plausible solutions from information that they are able to gather.</p>
    <p>Staurois finds an example in how Holt Vinir had been organizing the various flotillas under his (technical) control. Given how he was able to operate a wide network of trade that stretched many, many miles with flotillas gone for years at a time, could be worth a look.</p>
    <p>As Skati, Holt had complete control over the flotillas. The Skati's orders were law. He was able to give strict instructions, timetables, and routes. This central authority led to a very efficient trade network.</p>
    <p>Holt was no tyrant, though, and he understood that the river elves knew their trade well. He had assembled a council of Oarmasters that he called the Naemed. Whenever flotillas were gathered, the Naemed could bring issues to him. If a majority of Oarmasters voted for or against a particular course of action, they could overrule Holt. If an Oarmaster disobeyed or disregarded an order from the Skati, they could be punished severely (though Holt was a nice guy, the worst he ever did was strip someone's Oarmaster title.) If something needed to change, Holt would find a way to send a message to the flotilla in question and the order would have to be obeyed.</p>
    <p>Staurois believes this could be adapted, with the council of Oarmasters choosing their Skati surrogate (Grand Oarmaster, or whatever it would be called,) instead of it being lifetime. Or maybe elect for lifetime.</p>
    <p>Smilisca finds something else. It's an ancient title that long predates Holt - Rivermaster. By his best reckoning, the title is something akin to a river bond, but for government. When the flotillas gather, the Rivermaster has total authority over the flotillas. He or she would have great authority to make decisions about the actions, decisions, and plans of the river elves. The Oarmasters of various flotillas could bring challenges or questions to the Rivermaster, but ultimately the decision was theirs.</p>
    <p>When the flotillas separated, however, the Rivermaster was just another Oarmaster. When separated, the Oarmasters all had broad autonomy. They would generally follow the plans laid out by the Rivermaster, but they could interpret it how they wanted and implement broad changes of plan. If they did something radically different, they would have to explain it to the Rivermaster at the next gathering of the flotillas. The Rivermaster could take punitive action, but was bound by law to only do so if the Oarmaster did something that was clearly harmful to river elves as a whole.</p>
    <p>The Rivermaster was generally the oldest and most experienced Oarmaster. In times where that wasn't clear, the Oarmasters could call a Rendezvous to select a Rivermaster themselves. They could also call a Rendezvous to oust a Rivermaster and select a new one, though that could only be done with all Oarmasters present and unanimous.</p>
    <p>With these competing plans, well, Staurois and Smilisca get to arguing. Staurois thinks that a version of the more structured Grand Oarmaster plan would be more stable, and allow the complicated and interconnected trade schedules the river elves have been relying on. Smilisca thinks that plan is too restrictive, especially without a reliable and rapid communication network. He believes that the Rivermaster position would allow greater flexibility in the absence of communications - not to mention it's a river elf system, not a Lycan one. Either way, they spend some time yelling about it and probably need to cool off. </p>
    <p>You will take a setback die next turn if you try to use Creation to come to a decision. However, they did get plenty of good information. Any attempt to use Creation to make a civilization Aspect related to one or both of these concepts will receive an Upgrade.</p>
    <p><b>Eina:</b> hears tell of a winged elf memorial to a slaughtered Coyote town. She decides to visit it with a few of her followers.</p>
    <p>The winged elf memorial is further up the river from Asavardi. As she rounds a bend in the river, the cliff draws back from the water and curves into a broad, sheltered bank. Greenery has been left to spread where it will, but a well-maintained path, made of stone mosaic, winds through the patches of ferns and flowers and into a modest grove of trees. The trees, mostly darkwood and pine, are transplants from the top of the cliffs, but they’re growing tall and healthy. There is a small plaque along the path that simply reads ‘The Grove’. </p>
    <p>Within the protective circle of the trees are rows of small markers, several hundred of them. Clovers and wildflowers have been encouraged to grow over the graves, and some of the markers have creepers climbing up them. The markers are mostly sturdy wooden posts, and many are draped with small tokens: feathers, flowers, jewelry, simple pendants. Back in the shade of the young trees are a few carved wooden benches, subtly etched with abstracted patterns. </p>
    <p>The surface of the cliff is pockmarked with many small openings, and one has been smoothed and expanded into a small grotto. A tiny trickle of a spring comes from the back wall, and a sculpted bowl has been made for it. The quiet sound of the spring harmonizes with the wind through the trees and the deeper sounds of the river.</p>
    <p>Sound is very important to the winged elves. The Grove is filled with windchimes of all sizes and materials, and two windharps, one large and one small, bracket the field of markers. It is quiet, but never silent.</p>
    <p>Eina might find this place peaceful. </p>
    <h4><b>Dilemma:</b> Just Around the River Bend</h4>
    <p><b>Status:</b> Beginning</p>
    <p>With Arpenter's success, and with a journey into the badlands under its belt, there's mumbling in the population about making a return trip to the river elves' original home. Brightwood makes traversing the badlands and other such continental divides much more plausible. Especially with the terrifying rumors of Wolf Elves, many river elves are beginning to openly wonder if returning home is the best option. Sure it might violate the treaty and piss off Lock, but he's not an elf, and the agreement was made under duress. </p>
    <p>The desire among many elves to return home is rising. Some want to abandon their new home here, others just want to see if it's possible. Depending on how possible they view returning home and how dangerous they view staying here (and confidence in leadership,) elves may attempt to break off from established flotillas and make a break for it. This could escalate into an Event with economic and/or morale stress, or even cause settlements to shrink in size. If confidence is lost completely, flotillas may even go rogue and attempt the journey themselves.</p>
    <p>It is not at that point yet, but it might get there. You will have to find a balance between fear and hope… assuming the river elves want to stay in this new land at all.</p>
