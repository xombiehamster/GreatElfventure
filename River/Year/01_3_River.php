<h1>Year 1 - Winter</h1>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Due to the need to build additional rafts to house those made homeless by the flood anway, the river elves of Partager take it on themselves to specialize.  The new construction efforts go into barges designed with portable cranes, workshops for woodworkers, and tools for raftsmiths. </p>
    <p>This attempts to add the aspect, “Construction Rafts,” to Partager, using the Investment trapping of Infrastructure, putting to use the bonus for inspired engineers and acts of the average river elf.  This uses 2 Ability, 1 Proficiency, and 2 Boost dice: 4 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Staurois recalls that their Fire Elf cousins have settled on the river headed away from the swamp to the North, and they desired wood.  Unaware of the unorganized attempt by the common elves to add an aspect to their settlement, he spends a Fate point to motivate the Economic branch to a second action this season.  Using the Merchants trapping of Trade, Staurois gets help carefully harvesting wood from the forested swamp to bring with them on the upriver journey.</p>
    <p>This picks up the Territory Aspect: Forest, for later trade.  They roll: 2 Ability, 1 Proficiency: 3 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs.</p>
