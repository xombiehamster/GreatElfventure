    <p>Pretty much immediately after getting her mail and making sure everyone’s settled, Litoria vanishes into the wilderness.  She makes vague excuses about maintaining her tactical readiness by honing her ranger skills away from the flotilla.</p>
    <h3 id="back">Roleplay Event 2.3.1: <a href="../Bonus/3_A Cold Reunion.php">A Cold Reunion</a></h3>
    <p>And when Litoria returns, she seems almost happy.  She’s certainly more relaxed than she’s been in years.  Keeping up her wilderness survival skills must be good for her mental health.  Her therapist certainly believes so.</p>
    <p>The day after Litoria returns, she and Eina vanish into the swamp again.  When they return, it’s with a destination and a plan in mind.  They’ve found somewhere special, somewhere with water that is especially clean: a small spring among the mangroves, far enough inland that the water is only mildly brackish.  With Litoria leading the way, Eina, Ny, and Staurois head to this secluded place to wait.  The Ranidae family raft is flanked by a pair of guards in tiny kayaks: one of the Eyes in the Dark and a Crocodilian.  </p></p>
    <p>	The Ranidae family settles in to wait, as it’s obvious at this point that the wait will not be terribly long.  Ny has been having practice contractions for several days, and Eina’s entreaties to Calestros suggest that the time will be soon.  When the contractions finally begin in earnest the elf and her midwife retreat into the cold, clear water, to labor on the stream’s sandy bottom.  Staurois waits nervously with the guards.</p>
    <p>	“Is alright to be skeerd,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukeit_Hill_frog">Allophryne Allophrynidae</a>, the Crocodilian says, patting him on the back with affection, “I were dang petrified when mine done hatched, en that a might while ago, me.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulyrana">Rulyrana Centrolenidae</a>, the Eye on guard duty, says nothing, but she flashes the new father a knowing smile.  She turns her eyes back toward the water, staying alert for danger.</p>
    <p>“We waited a long time for this, weh.”  Staurois confides in his vigil companions, “Mais, I still catch the <span class="tooltip">freesons<span class="tooltiptext">Goosebumps</span></span> ta think on alla things may go wrong, me.”  The little cayman on his shoulder peeps agreement.</p>
    <p>“Ny’s a strong un,” Allophryne reassures the Oarmaster, “she got this.  She <span class="tooltip">tete dure<span class="tooltiptext">Hard-headed, stubborn</span></span>, she is.”</p>
    <p>Seated on the raft with their feet in the water, all three keeping the vigil for Ny and the baby can sense the moment when the child is born into the water.  It’s a sense that other elves lack, more than smell, more than sight, more than taste, and more than just touch.  Ny clutches the infant to her chest while Eina assists her with the afterbirth.  Even blinded, they intimately know what passes in the water that surrounds them.  </p>
    <p>Which means that they also know that these brackish waters are far from empty.  The Ranidae family alligator, Pierre, lazes in a sunny spot with only his fat tail hanging in the water.  Schools of fish dart in the stream.  And a bull shark has caught the scent of blood in the water.</p>
    <p>This is why giving birth requires a military presence.</p>
    <p>The three keeping guard slip quietly into the water, Allophryne and Rulyrana armed with viciously barbed spears.  River elves do not, as a rule, make threats.  Either everything is fine, or the violence is immediate.  A shark does not behave in a way that is too different from this.  They know it too well.  The tiny cayman’s eyes light up with a bright amber glow as Staurois carefully casts a selected spell.  </p>
    <p>The nautical monster moves to dart between the newborn’s guardians.  It is too fast and slips past Rulyrana’s spear.   Allophryne’s spear hits at an oblique angle and fails to penetrate the shark’s rough skin.</p>
    <p>Staurois shifts shape as he launches himself toward the shark.  Thick coils of an anaconda’s body wrap themselves around the foe.  He grasps it securely and begins to squeeze.  The shark did not stand a chance.  Staurois wraps himself around its gills, cutting off the shark’s ability to breathe.  He crushes it in his grasp.</p>
    <p>He releases the serpent’s shape when he feels the shark’s heartbeat cease.  Allophryne helps drag the carcass onto the family raft, while Rulyrana continues to keep careful watch in case there are more.</p>
    <p>When Ny is ready, she and Eina emerge from the privacy of the spring onto the safety of the raft.  A tiny voice cries out complaint at being brought into the cold air.  Staurois’s heart breaks at the sound.  A child, his child, is taking their first breath of free air.</p>
    <p>He helps Ny onboard while the honor guard prepares a meal of their adversary.  The new parents retreat into the warmth of their raft, brasiers heating stones to keep the curtained room full of steam.  Weak from effort, exhausted, and starving, Ny passes the bundled infant into her raft bond’s arms.</p>
    <p>“His name is Natator.”</p>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> Partager drops off their delivery of ash and iron at Ft. Alfyr.  In exchange for the deliveries, they request use of the blade elves’ training facilities to put together a second division.  Staurois considers this a more than fair trade.  Using the <i>Merchants</i> trapping of <b>Trade</b> they roll 2 Ability and 1 Proficiency die: <kbd>0 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> With Staurois a bit distracted, Smilisca reminds the Eyes that they should keep doing what they’re doing.  This uses the <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> and rolls 1 Ability die: <kbd>2 advantage, 0 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
	<p><b>Military: </b>When Litoria returns from her week-long sabbatical, she immediately takes over for Staurois in heading up the efforts to improve their ability to defend the flotilla.  She seeks volunteers from Partager and from among the new arrivals to form the core of a division to remain in Winter Quarters year round as its guardians.  This Brave Beavers division will be made up of a specialist core: Eels to dig in and lurk in the shallow water.</p>
	<p>Invoking the Training Facilities aspect for free, and gaining the cooperation of the blade elves, they use the <i>Drill</i> trapping of <b>Conventional Military</b> skill with the blade elves’ bonuses so the river elves get to roll: 2 Ability and 2 Proficiency dice: 3 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Eina, her assistant clergy, Smilisca, and even Acris are nervously excited on the cold midwinter morning chosen for the ritual casting.  They carefully selected the date and time to be one most fortuitously connected to the timing of the tides.  The group of them swim out to the edge of the mangroves, where they can see the breakers on the sandbar out at sea.  Acris helps place heated stones tethered to floating buoys holding burning incense along that invisible boundary between the swamp and the ocean.</p>
    <p>The ritual Eina and her assistants devised is actually quite simple spellcasting, but something about this being the first piece of actual magic being worked on behalf of the flotilla meant that it requires some very special theatrics.  Many of Partager’s residents and some of the newcomers float in the water behind the burning incense line to watch.  Even Litoria came to watch.  Eina and Smilisca give Sauver a pat for good luck before taking their places at the front of the line.</p>
    <p>“We stand, ami,” Eina begins, holding Smilisca’s hand in hers and facing the waves, “at your border, <span class="tooltip">grand-mère grand-père<span class="tooltiptext">Grandmother grandfather</span></span> Calestros.  As the rivers flow to Your <span class="tooltip">Mer<span class="tooltiptext">Sea</span></span>, we flow to You.”</p>
    <p>Both the cleric and the wizard bow toward the surf.  Smilisca traces a set of symbols from the Sylvan abjad, writing out the contents of the spell they have prepared.  The few gathered priests and priestesses of the newly-formed religious order begin the low hum of a song, which is quickly picked up by a lone fiddler in the crowd.</p>
    <p>The two stand in the stinging saltwater, watching the stars twinkling on the horizon, and let the glowing symbols fill their eyes while the music fills their minds.  Smilisca adds the name of Partager’s next destination to the ritual casting, the Goldfall River.</p>
    <p>"We axe you for advice, grand-mère grand-père Calestros,” Eina speaks again, “will this river stay in its banks, or will it pass us to our rests?”  Eina then lowers a copy of Smilisca’s rope map of the Goldfall River into the ocean.  Water soaks the silken cords, and the tide, now retreating, pulls it from her webbed hands.  Someone, somewhere, rolls 1 Proficiency die for the <i>Magic</i> trapping of the <b>Spirituality</b> skill: <kbd>1 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</kbd>.</p>
    <p>The gathered river elves wait in silence for the answer.  Incense smoke drifts over calm water.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b>The blade elves are absolutely thrilled for the shipments of iron and ash you bring them. They have been planning on using them for some time. They have already been planning in depth how to put them to good use. The trade goes well, thanks to your excellent planning and well-defined route.</p>
    <p>In fact, it goes so incredibly well it's like your two logistics experts have been spending a large amount of time together and get along really well for some reason. Odd that.</p>
    <p>For the results of the Blade Elves’ military training, see below.</p>
    <p>While the trade was more than a success, all that lagniappe you gave out kinda hurt your stores. If you take a trade action next turn, it will be with a setback die due to lack of goodies to give people when trading.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> The Eyes are on watch. The good news is that Winter Quarters' location appears to still be a secret. The Eyes in the swamp spot nothing this turn other than the natural life that's always there. Partager is quiet too, nestled just out of viewing distance of the Fort. Your remaining Eyes stick with Litoria and the group training at the Fort. Unfortunately this leaves them spread a little thin, and your Eyes have to focus on keeping a watch on only the most sensitive information.</p>
    <p>Midway through the training operation, something happens at Fort Álfyr. In the middle of the night there is a major commotion from the central buildings of the Fort itself. Your Eyes are watching, and quickly move to secure any of your vital information that may be at risk. While doing so they witness several bright flashes of light coming from rooftops around the Fort, and one Eye reports seeing several figures moving along the rooftops.</p>
    <p>The next morning, an envelope sealed with black wax is delivered to Litoria. Inside is a report written in a strange looping handwriting:</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Contact Report, immediate dispensation.</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Operatives Involved: Skulk, [Redacted]</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Lead Operative: Skulk</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Reporting Operative: Skulk</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Incident Summary: At approximately midnight last night, Operative [Redacted] discovered suspicious activity. Blade elf of unknown identity attempting to access personal residence of Quartermaster Terje Paavi. Operative immediately reported incursion to Lead Operative Skulk. Lead immediately assembled capture team to apprehend interloper. Upon team making contact and attempting to apprehend interloper, interloper deployed alchemical countermeasures to evade team. Interloper was able to escape initial apprehension. Lead scrambled all available Operatives to intercept interloper, however interloper continued to deploy alchemical countermeasures. Operatives unable to apprehend or positively identify interloper.</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Casualty Report: Lead Operative Skulk suffered burns where struck with countermeasures. Operatives [Redacted] also suffered similar injuries, Operatives [Redacted] suffered minor cut and stab wounds attempting to physically restrain interloper. Operative [Redacted] found highly lethal poison had been used. Immediate on site medical aid provided by Corpsmaster Siiri Maar prevented fatalities.</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Lead Observations: Interloper deployed sunrods modified with extreme light amplification and incendiary/adhesive elements. Operatives struck with these items were burned, and all Operatives in immediate area were blinded. Interloper deployed such light-based countermeasures frequently, indicating awareness of exploitable weakness to light among Operatives. Lead believes that these were specifically designed to target her Operatives.</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Interloper was unable to access Paavi residence. Interloper was likely disguised. Quartermaster Paavi was not in his residence when entry attempt was made. Attempt was made on Quartermaster's personal residence, not official work space. Lead believes that interloper may have been attempting to compromise river elf security by exploiting Paavi's personal connections. Attempt was foiled, no intelligence compromised.</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Response: Operatives will increase security on all high value personnel and target locations. Operatives will cooperate with local authorities in future apprehension efforts to minimize exploitation of weaknesses. Quartermaster Paavi advised to secure all information about river elves that may be contained in personal locations. Review of specific countermeasures used against operatives ongoing.</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">Report Concludes</p>
    <p id="SkulkLetter">This report contains sensitive information. Either secure or commit to memory and dispose.</p>
    <h3 id="back2">Roleplay Event 2.3.2: <a href="../Bonus/5_A Concerned Cousin.php">A Concerned Cousin</a></h3>
    <p><b>Military:</b>  Once the trade goes down, Ehra requests a meeting with Litoria and a few other river elf leaders. He lets you know that he has been planning on making the barracks and training grounds at Fort Alfyr into a proper military academy. He wants to do this not just for the blade elves, but for all of the assembled elves. Military training is difficult, and he wants his war scholars and advanced training facilities to be ready for every elf.</p>
    <p>He realizes, however, that Blade Elf training methods are limited to, well, blade elves. He requests time with Litoria and any of your other experienced soldiers and military personnel to train the war scholars in their method of fighting. With this, the planned academy at Fort Alfyr can be a repository of all the assembled martial knowledge of elves. Then, their knowledge may be passed on to future generations.</p>
    <p>The Brave Beavers turn out  to be something of a proof of concept. Litoria leads the planning in training them, but the facilities and wealth of knowledge available to the blade elves makes her job far, far easier. The war scholars get involved in the process as well, not just to teach but to learn more about how the river elves fight.</p>
    <p>The blade elves end up learning quite a bit, as does Litoria. The blade elves learn quite a bit about fighting in and around water, appreciate the dedication to stealthy ambush tactics, and are overall thrilled with the arrangement. The river elves get more education in traditional defensive tactics that might be necessary in protecting Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p>Overall, the training of the Eels and creation of the Brave Beavers is a rousing success. Ehra thanks you for proving the concept that a central military academy could work, and gives his personal gratitude to Litoria for the dedication she treated it with.</p>
    <p>Ehra also has a parting gift: His smiths immediately put the iron to good use, and a decent chunk of it went into an Accessorizing check. The blade elves present the Eels with mastercraft longswords (arming swords, obviously) made of high quality blade elf steel and washed in copper, just the way river elves like them.</p>
    <p>On a more personal note, Ehra speaks to Litoria in private.</p>
    <p>"You seem driven, Litoria. I haven't seen you this vital since the end of the war. I am not going to pry. We both know we'll always have need for swords, but with recent events I've had a nagging feeling we will need them sooner rather than later. I get the impression you have the same feeling. Perhaps we're simply soldiers looking for a war, perhaps not. I want you to know that I trust you, and I trust your instincts. I am with you, Litoria."</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Eina and Smilisca watch the cord float off with the waves. There are a few moments of silence, before a slight wind blows in from the ocean. The waves pick up slightly, cresting to small whitecaps. Smilisca holds onto his hat. From beneath the waves, they see a dim green glow that brightens. The thin line of the cord is glowing beneath the waters surface.</p>
    <p>The light spreads from the cord towards the swamp. Eina and Smiliscia feel it wash over their feet - a cool, tingling sensation on their skin. The light shatters into dozens of different lines that weave their way through the mangroves behind the group. There is a low humming noise as magical energy gently churns the water around the pair.</p>
    <p>The assembled river elves behind them see the lines assemble themselves and move back through the swamp. Other elves further back in the flotilla report seeing the lines of light head south, as if towards the Goldfall. Back at the shore, Smilisca and Eina are illuminated by golden light.</p>
    <p>For some reason they can’t articulate, they both look down at the waves. In the churning water, they can see their faces reflected. Their features are mixed, mishmashed, and confused by the breaking water. In the waves, they see not just their faces but features no river elf has, all coming together at once.</p>
    <p>A strange, disjointed voice calls out just loud enough for the two to hear:</p>
    <p>“Weal.”</p>
    <p>With that, the wind calms and the waves recede. The glowing lights return backwards from the swamp, out to sea and fades. The smell of incense still lingers. It worked.</p>
