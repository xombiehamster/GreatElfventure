    <p>Everyone’s parked back at Winter Quarters for the year.  The flapmail system is officially not invited to build an office at the <i>highly secret location</i>, and instead the flotilla agrees to pick up their mail at Fort Alfyr when they pass through.</p>
    <p>Early in the season, <b>Bryti</b> messages Litoria with a Sending: “I will be late. They need our help, it's our duty. I will see you as soon as I can, I promise.</p>
    <p>I miss you.”</p>
    <p>Litoria replies: “I miss you too.  If I’m not home when you get here, look for me at the fort, weh?”</p>

    <p><b>Economic:</b> It is time to split into a new flotilla again.  There are enough refugees, and Partager’s construction rafts are present.  Everyone is ready to make this happen.</p>
    <p>Despite some concerns that it might wake their ancient sea elf rivals, the promise of bigger fish in the sea draws hungry river elves to try their luck casting nets into it.  They find a bounty of fish and shrimp available.  The fish are large and delicious and the shrimp are jumbo and both taste great cooked into a nice rice ball.</p>
    <p>In order to exploit their Coastal Wetlands, they attempt to build a new flotilla to better traverse its salty shores.  And they remember to include storage onboard specifically for nice, fresh, potable water.</p>
    <p>They put to use the new <i>River Refugees</i> aspect to immediately invoke it, and also invoke the <i>Coastal Wetlands</i> aspect for effect to build boats rather than rafts.  This also benefits from Partager’s presence by gaining the automatic advantage from the <i>Construction Rafts</i>, which they also invoke for a bonus.  This uses the <i>Establishment</i> trapping of <b>Infrastructure</b> and rolls: 2 Ability, 3 Proficiency dice: 4 advantage, 2 successes, 1 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Economic (motivated):</b> Having promised the Crag a lumber shipment, Staurois borrows any elves not involved in other projects to put together a lumber shipment.  They don’t make use of the Brightwood, as it would not be appropriate for this request.  But they do make sure not to deforest any one particular area.  This uses the <i>Merchants</i> trapping of <b>Trade</b> and rolls 2 Ability 1 Proficiency dice: 3 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> SPIES! SPIES EVERYWHERE!  <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> rolls 2 Ability dice: 2 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Military: </b> Litoria takes the Brave Beavers to Fort Alfyr to train new recruits of Eels.  With so many issues with wolf elves, she feels it necessary to increase security at Winter Quarters by increasing its military complement.</p>

    <p>Cooperating with the Blade Elves, they use the <i>Drill</i> trapping of <b>Military Science</b> and the Blade Elf dice pool: 3 Ability, 1 Proficiency: 3 advantage, 4 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Working in tandem with the elves set to the task of assembling new rafts for the incoming refugees, several fisherelves spearhead a new concept: adding a deeper keel to the center of a raft instead of a flat bottom.  This should allow the boat to stay stable in deeper water.  Keeping the total draft of the boat from being too deep should still allow safe river travel, but does come with the drawback of limiting the boat from traversing overland.  It couldn’t be rolled over logs while staying upright.</p>
    <p>Figuring out how to actually put the theories on new ship design into practice is the job for a skilled engineer.  And while that might not be Smilisca personally, he certainly does help complete the technical diagrams and arrange for appropriate supplies.  They put to use the <i>Research</i> trapping of <b>Academics</b> and roll: 2 Ability dice: 0 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Character:</b> Nobody can find Eina for most of the season.  Nobody even remotely thinks to ask where she might possibly be.  She’s busy making up for lost time.  (78%, no risk.)</p>
    <p><b>Character:</b> When Allophryne makes it to Winter Quarters, Terry and Rulyrana corner him and drag him through the construction zones to introduce him around and see if any of the new refugees are some of his own missing family.  And if he happens to spot any Afflicted while he’s being reintroduced to old friends, then that’s an excellent side benefit of his presence.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> <b>Flotilla</b> - Congratulations! You have successfully created the flotilla Envoyer, and boy what a flotilla it is!</p>

    </ul>
    <p>The construction of the new flotilla goes extremely well. These are not boats, not rafts - they are ships. In the old days before the exodus, river elves had ships like this, travelling all the way along the western coast up as far north as New Highelf. They are deep keeled vessels, capable of being moved by either oar or sail. They are a mix of river elf raft design and Lycan style longboats, capable of longer voyages than either. They have the deep water capability and resilience of a longboat, but they have the interior rooms, living spaces, live wells, water storage, and fishing tools you would expect on a flotilla raft. With a large number of these vessels working together, even long ocean voyages with heavy cargo should be possible.</p>
    <p>Even better, your current environment is extremely well-suited for building this kind of ship. Numerous kinds of hardwood have been used in the past, with types of oak being favored. The more inland parts of your coastal forest have interesting varieties of oak, with white oak being the most common but also extremely large, ancient live oaks with huge branches that oddly grow in just the right shape for a boat hull.</p>
    <p>By layering these types of oak together and building much of the interior structure from Brightwood, your craftselves are able to build ships that are both very lightweight and buoyant for their size, but also extremely durable. The layered hardwood exterior makes them nearly impervious to impact damage and resistant to fire, while the brightwood superstructure makes them so buoyant that they stay floating even in the event of a capsize or after taking on a massive amount of water. They truly are an example of the river elves’ mastery of their trade.</p>
    <p>Take that in your seashell bikini, sea elves.</p>
    <p>Due to the Triumph of engineering in discovering a unique way to construct a hull, your Ocean Nomads aspect has been improved with the Ironsides element as described above. Further, your sustainable forestry practices have allowed you to stockpile these hardwoods for future constructions. This Oak Stockpile will provide a boost die on your next check to build or repair a flotilla at Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p><b>Lumber Shipment:</b> Such as it goes, collecting a shipment of lumber for the Crag is fairly easy. The real question is in determining what kind of wood the Crag will really need for their various construction projects. They described mostly using it for building scaffolding and aiding in construction, not in building permanent structures. </p>
    <p>Carefully selecting the varieties of oak best suited for such tasks, your tradeselves have gathered a shipment that should handily fit the Crag’s needs. This carefully selected  Lumber Shipment Aspect will provide a boost die on your trade with the Crag. If enough Advantage is left over, it may even provide the Crag with a boost die on their own checks to use it.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Allophryne has an interesting time with the dark elves. “Domawit” Valerian (call him Valerian, Shyrendora is Domawit) has nestled himself in the dark elves’ settlement, buried deep under the caldera in a settlement that Allophryne has absolutely zero chance of pronouncing correctly. Further, Valerian has surrounded himself with his most loyal followers, making the settlement a stronghold of insular and isolationist traditionalists. Getting a river elf in there is not easy.</p>
    <p>Still, it can be done. The dark elves are working on a mine cart transport system for delivering silver from the deeper mines to the surface settlements for trade. They have been working on plans involving river elf ratcheting pulleys to safely increase mechanical advantage (pulleys! Finally, someone understands!) and by claiming Allophryne is a consultant, they are able to get him deeper into dark elf territory without arousing much suspicion.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, getting close to Valerian is another matter entirely. He maintains a layer of supporters pretty much everywhere he goes, and “accidentally” bumping into him is well, really not an option. You only get close to Valerian if he wants you to, at least that’s what they claim.</p>
    <p>Allophryne tries to get close, but is ultimately rebuffed. He gets to within the same room as Valerian gives a political speech at a tavern, but Valerian’s bodyguards intercept Allophryne before he can get close enough to use his sight.</p>
    <p>However, this reveals something shocking in and of itself. Allophryne had his Sight active when the bodyguards intercepted. To his shock, one of the bodyguards had a visible black aura. It surrounded his body, giving the impression of wolflike ears and a lupine face. Oddly, it was clearly not what he saw when he used his sight on Hunger, Bryti, or Cantia. It’s something else. Bryti also hasn’t seen something like that before, but suggests it might represent some kind of magic used to disguise the elf in question.</p>
    <p>Regardless, it is quite clear: Something is happening under the table in dark elf territory.</p>
    <p><b>Winter Quarters:</b> Things stay quiet at Winter Quarters. Industrious river elves build in peace. The river elves’ greatest secret stays safe. Terry’s anxiety problems get slightly better.</p>
    <p>No, really. Everything is fine.</p>
    <p><b>Fort Álfyr:</b> The training at the fort goes well. With the Wolf visiting, the Eyes apply extra watch to make sure she stays unbothered. The only interesting thing they note is a group of female Crag who visit the Fort during the season, accompanied by a somewhat rowdy band of fire elves.</p>
    <p>The Eyes watch this group with caution. At one point, they briefly speak to “Katya,” but then move on. They seem more interested in the blade elves of Fort Álfyr than anyone else. The  Eyes keep on them for a little while, but it becomes apparent that they are harmless and merely asking very broad questions about other elves in general, perhaps out of curiosity. The fire elves were hired as lowland guides, to make sure that they can meet other elves safely.</p>
    <p>The Eyes chalk it up as a positive that Crag appear to be interacting with other elves more, and do not bother the group further. They generally leave the parked river elf rafts alone, at any rate.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> Blade elves are starting to expect river elves this time of year. Not only that, but they helped create the concept of Eels in the first place. Getting their training going is easy. Your leadership is starting to get along quite well with the war scholars, and in fact a few of your officers have been officially inducted as Masters as well for better cooperation with the War Scholars.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, you are successfully able to recruit a new unit of Eels. It almost feels routine.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Smilisca keeps a close eye on the construction project of Envoyer. He carefully catalogs every new method and material used in the construction of this new type of raft. Slowly, a technical diagram for this new type of ship takes form. It is something unique to the river elves, something equally suited to river and deep water travel. As Envoyer is completed, Smilisca ensures that the construction of these beautiful ships is not a one-off event.</p>
    <p>With the construction of Envoyer both completed and well-documented, Smilisca shares his technical diagrams and construction notes with both the fisherelves and the handful of permanent inhabitants of Winter Quarters. It generates a lot of talk, and a lot of ideas. More of these ships could be constructed, and perhaps there could be an expansion of the raft construction facilities that already exist at Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p>These technical diagrams for creating new ships provide an interesting option: Construction of an actual permanent fishing fleet at Winter Quarters. There is some debate as to the utility of this, as it would require constructing permanent coastal facilities that might be visible from the oceans. People are concerned that this might give away the location of Winter Quarters. Never know when those pesky sea elves might be watching.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, these docks would also provide a permanent food source for Winter Quarters that could be scaled up when the flotillas congregate. It would also make it far easier for Envoyer to dock at winter quarters and repair their vessels.</p>
    <p>You receive an Upgrade from this research. It may either be applied to your next check to create a seagoing or coastal flotilla, or to a check to upgrade the Coastal Wetlands to Coastal Wetland Shipyards, representing the large facilities created with not only fishing, but docking, maintaining, and creating oceangoing flotilla.</p>
    <p>The choice is Smilisca’s.</p>
    <p><b>Misc:</b> A letter arrives from Shadimon:</p>
    <p id="ShadimonLetter">To Staurois,</p>
    <p id="ShadimonLetter">I hope this letter finds you well. I find myself in need of advice, and was hoping you had some to give.</p>
    <p id="ShadimonLetter">Before the War, we lived in villages that mostly managed themselves. When the Lycans came, we were too disorganized to act. </p>
    <p id="ShadimonLetter">We need room to spread our wings, and have been expanding our territory here. As that happens, however, we run into the problem of governance. I will not see us isolated and alone again, but our history has no precedents for a single, central government. I know whatever I decide will have to be given to the community for a final decision, but I’m at a loss as to what the options are or how to implement them. We have some books from Skaplyndi on the matter, but I would very much prefer an elven viewpoint. </p>
    <p id="ShadimonLetter">Thank you,</p>
    <p id="ShadimonLetter">Shadimon</p>
    <h4><b>Dilemma:</b> Just around the river bend</h4>
    <p><b>Status:</b> Rising</p>
    <p>Rumors have started to spread about the possible journey to the old rivers. Volunteers are gathered. Provisions are acquired. Plans are made. There is electric excitement about the opportunity. Outside Winter Quarters the river elves stay silent, but in the safety of their swamps they are abuzz with discussion and theory about what may be found there, and what may be done if it is within reach.</p>
    <p>There is no turning back now. This expedition must happen.</p>
