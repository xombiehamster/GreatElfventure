    <p><b>Character:</b> When the flotilla part ways, for the first time, the leadership also separates.  Staurois, as is traditional, continues with Partager.  Smilisca and Acris also continue to travel with Partager.  Eina stays with her husband for this new journey and joins Envoyer.  Litoria follows Prosalirus to join Arpenter.</p>
    <p><b>Letter, mailed from Ft. Alfyr:</b></p>

    <p><b>Economic:</b> It may be a long while coming, but Partager had promised to bring copper when they returned to Surt again.  And here they have their rafts laden with the heavy metal, drawing a low draft up the relatively calm and wide <i>Burning Wolf River</i>.  Sure, nobody likes the water from the Maar.  It’s smelly and feels gross on the skin.  But the tributaries to the Burning Wolf River are plenty safe to drink.</p>
    <p>Using their stunt <i>Elf Express</i>, Partager parks near Surt to complete a cooperative trade.  They deliver the promised copper shipment and request finished goods and tools in trade.  There is still a lot of goodwill left over from their previous visit to Surt, and the river elves are excited to see the city again.  This uses the <i>Merchants</i> trapping of <b>Trade</b> and rolls: 2 Ability dice, 1 Proficiency die, and 1 Bonus die: 2 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <h3 id="back2">Boxraft Children 4.4.2: <a href="../Bonus/17_A Surtian Confusion.php">A Surtian Confusion</a></h3>
    <p><b>Economic (motivated):</b> Envoyer may not have much in the way of trade goods collected before they set out on their maiden journey, but they can’t be faulted for their enthusiasm.  It is not, however, a very far voyage to get from Winter Quarters to Fort Alfyr.</p>
    <p>They happily put themselves to the task of fishing, diving for pearl oysters, and in general making themselves very useful oceanic guests in exchange for whatever tools, rope, and useful goods the blade elves agree to exchange with them.  This uses the <i>Merchants</i> trapping of <b>Trade</b> and rolls: 2 Ability dice and 1 Proficiency die: 1 advantage, 3 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> Rulyrana has parked herself at Winter Quarters, seeing as it’s the softest target while the flotilla head upriver.  She and the Eyes who stayed behind, keep up the work of making absolutely certain that the tiny outpost left behind when the flotilla depart is not stumbled upon accidentally.  It would do no good for there to be an ambush waiting for them when the flotilla return.</p>
    <p>This uses the <i>Cloak and Dagger</i> trapping of <b>Spycraft</b> and rolls 2 Ability dice: 0 advantage, 2 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Military: </b>Someone apparently left Rulyrana in charge of Winter Quarters, despite the captain of the Brave Beavers’s protests.  She herds any available pathfinders toward the unexplored area between the Marrain and Burning Wolf rivers.  They’ll need to know what’s there to best be able to organize their defenses.  And previous engagements suggest that Westward is the direction any additional armies of Afflicted may arrive from.</p>
    <p>This uses the <i>Pathfinders</i> trapping of <b>Reconnaissance</b> and rolls 2 Ability dice: 1 advantage, 1 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Staurois and Smilisca have been left alone together again.  And they have had time to sit on their opinions and consider the consequences of any potential actions they may take toward organizing an official government.</p>
    <p>Both determine that at least the title, Rivermaster, is a good one.  But they don’t really want it to be a Skati-analog, and they don’t really want it to default to some old out of touch toot-toot.  But the <i>Rendezvous</i>, now that’s got some great potential.   For logistical reasons, it’s definitely going to be best for there to be one person managing the schedules and making sure agreements with external parties are consistent.  But using the Rendezvous to pick that person to be the Rivermaster is definitely a grand idea.  Finally, something else both the Oarmaster and the Navigator can agree on!</p>
    <p>Now to the harder details - what does the Rivermaster actually <i>do?</i>  Well, every flotilla already selects their own Oarmaster to handle their day-to-day logistical concerns: managing trade agreements, scheduling pit stops, handling interpersonal conflicts between members of the flotilla.  It should make sense for the Rivermaster to be the person who will work as the go-between for the Oarmasters on each flotilla, set policies for actions that affect all the flotilla, and fill the Oarmasters’ logistical duties when everyone is parked at Winter Quarters.</p>
    <p>So far, so good, but only so long as everything is going as planned.  What will they do when something goes wrong?  The two use much healthier debate tactics this time, working on their I-statements and not emotionally tying themselves to their suggestions.  And come to the conclusion that a wayward Oarmaster can be recalled by the Rivermaster, and a lousy Rivermaster can be recalled by a Rendezvous.  </p>
    <p>But what should their actual laws be?  Lycans had actual codified laws, and that was much more fair and open than the entirely subjective “know it when you see it” deal they have going at the moment.  Smilisca shrugs.  This sounds like a question for the first Rivermaster.  </p>
    <p>Building a shiny new governmental system (that sounds awfully republican right about now) uses the <i>Creation</i> trapping of <b>Academics</b> and rolls: 1 Ability die and 1 Proficiency die: 0 advantage, 4 successes, 0 triumphs</p>
    <p><b>Character:</b> Eina and Physalaemus manage to roll a 40% and don’t have any surprises to report.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Arpenter has a tough journey. This is technically a river, but only in the barest sense. It is shallow and unpredictable, and it may even dry up in some seasons or during dry spells. Still, thanks to Arpenter’s unique construction, it is traversable. Luckily, no mishaps or wolf elves happen to you. It’s still a risky route to take, and non-Brightwood flotillas might have serious trouble making the trip.</p>
    <p><b>Economic - Trade - Blade Elves:</b> As usual, the blade elves are happy to see you and happy to trade. Since they have no shortage of blacksmiths and are getting fairly regular iron shipments from the crag, they are more than happy to provide a Tool Shipment for your trading purposes. It contains a wide variety of general building and craft tools, all of utilitarian but acceptable quality. They are made to last, and should more than satisfy the cryptid elves’ needs.</p>
    <p>While you are able to get enough pearls to cover most of the trade costs, you run into an issue that blade elves are a practical people and don’t generally have much use or demand for that kind of thing. While you are able to make the trade, you have to expend a fair amount of your reserves of lagniappe- food, spices, curios, and whatever knicknacks you have that are used to sweeten the pot of trade.</p>
    <p>Due to this shortage of lagniappe, Envoyer will take a Setback die on any trade checks made next turn.</p>
    <p><b>Economic  - Fire Elves:</b> Your trade connections with the fire elves continue to hold strong. The fire elves have created a sheltered cove in Gerdr with the specific purpose of hosting flotillas, and seem to have been eagerly awaiting your arrival. Their merchant class seems to be on the rise. They are led by an organization called the Phoenix Imperialis (Barry’s faction) and they are looking to expand and create permanent business connections. Some of the merchants have even created rafts of their own to make it easier to conduct business with you.</p>
    <p>To your surprise, they are eager to show off Surt’s latest extravagant commodity - gold! Their gold is interesting, with a slight orange coloration to it that makes it quite unique and attractive. The fire elves have prepared it both as coinage, and as utilitarian stock that could be melted down and utilized for other purposes. This Gold Shipment can be utilized in many ways, not just as a currency.</p>
    <p>In return, the fire elves are hungry for copper, as they have a wide variety of uses planned for the utilitarian material. Can’t be the city of bronze without copper, after all. They happily purchase your entire stock. In the end, it’s an extremely profitable exchange for you, and the fire elves seem more than happy to have made it. They are in fact already talking about how they will have improved their facilities for you by the time of your next trading pass.</p>
    <p>Your Boost Die in trading with the fire elves is not expended, and continues to be present representing the excellent connections you have made with the fire elf merchant class.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b> This is your legal department approved declaration that you have found no spies, though honestly considering the rumors of stuff going on elsewhere in elfdom, it seems that the wolf elves at least may have been busy elsewhere.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> Your pathfinders make an extremely exciting discovery: Hippo tracks! This discovery is a big relief, as it explains why there haven’t been any hippos found in the vicinity of winter quarters. It appears that the travelling hippo pod cut north, through the somewhat marshy area between the marrain and burning wolf rivers. It appears that they went north, possibly along the coast, instead of heading into the mangrove swamps.</p>
    <p>The pathfinders maybe get a bit over-excited about this. They do not complete their assigned route, instead focusing on the territory that the hippo signs were found in. They spend an extensive amount of time examining the tracks of the hippo pod and deciding possible routes they may have taken.</p>
    <p>While they only scout one territory, the extra time they spend gathering information on the hippos is not in vain: Your next check made specifically to search for hippos will receive a boost die.</p>
    <h3 id="back3">Roleplay Event 4.4: <a href="../Bonus/18_A Deep River.php">A Deep River</a></h3>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Serious progress is made in creating a plan for a formal government. Smilisca and Staurois are able to come up with a pretty solid and workable plan based on the Rivermaster format, with increased checks and balances to ensure a balance of power between the Rivermaster and the Oarmasters. The Rendezvous also seems like an idea. In the end, they hash out a pretty reasonable plan.</p>
    <p>The issue is that they are only two elves. While they both have a plan that they believe will work quite well, this format they have thought up requires the consent of the other Oarmasters of Arpenter and Envoyer. After all, what sense would it make to implement a system that gives authority to Oarmasters by forcing it on them against their will?</p>
    <p>After some letter exchanging, well, it’s a bit tense. The other two Oarmasters (who probably at least need names) are a bit leery of a new position being created that’s technically above them. They do not agree to the Rivermaster position outright, but they do agree to a Rendezvous, at least once.</p>
    <p>This leads you to an interesting conundrum: This isn’t so much going to be a test of the system of government you have created as it is a test of just how much of a cohesive whole the river elves are.</p>
    <p>Due to this, a Rendezvous is planned for this coming winter when this flotilla arrives. When that happens, as part of your ongoing Dilemma, <i>Just Around the River Bend</i>, you will be required to make a rare Element check with your Loyalty skill. This will not require using one of your skill tracks and will be a bonus.</p>
    <p>In addition you have created the <i>Rivermaster Rendezvous</i> Aspect that you can Invoke for free for this specific event. </p>
    <h4><b>Dilemma:</b> Just around the river bend</h4>
    <p><b>Status:</b> Escalating</p>
    <p>With the upcoming expedition, the Rendezvous planned, and more hippo tracks discovered (and Boots!) the river elves are finally starting to talk openly about what they want their future to be. Arguments are breaking out here and there, heated debates, and passionate words arguing for varying degrees of leaving and staying, and as to staying together as a group at all.</p>
    <p>This new year may well be one of the most important in river elf history…</p>
    <p>Allophryne has a dream.</p>
    <p>He is below the surface of the water, laying flat on Blinkin's back as the alligator steadily swims upstream against a strong current. The water is cool and the only sound is the quiet rush of water moving over him.</p>
    <p>Above the surface, it is night. Through the rippling surface, Allophryne can see the flickering lights of stars. He sees Luna, but she is dull and quiet, the dark of a new moon. As he watches Luna shift and shimmer through the distortion of the water, the ripples on the surface spread over Her face. Through his eyes, they look like cracks.</p>
    <p>"Oh, Cher," Blinkin speaks with many voices, "You have so far to go, but you've gotten so much stronger."</p>
    <p>Allophryne sees his reflection on the surface. It is him, but it is not him. In the distorted reflection, he sees a wolf. It snaps and snarls at him in silent rage. Allophryne is not afraid.</p>
    <p>"She needs you.</p>
    <p>She needs you.</p>
    <p>She needs you.</p>
    <p>Oh, cher, you have to keep going.</p>
    <p>They all need you."</p>
    <p>Allophryne reaches forward. The reflection snaps at his fingers. He does not flinch away. The wolf tries to back away, but it is as tied to him as he is tied to it. He touches his reflection.</p>
    <p>"You've grown so much stronger.</p>
    <p>She has another gift for you.</p>
    <p>I think she loves you too."</p>
    <p>Allophryne's hand glows with warmth. The wolf howls in pain. The water ripples and splashes. When it settles, the wolf is gone. Allophryne is looking at his own reflection again, layered with Luna, layered with Calestros.</p>
    <p>"I am so proud of you."</p>
    <p>Allophryne has gained a level.</p>
    <p>He must choose Remove Curse as a spell.</p>
    <p>He is now capable of curing the affliction.</p>
    <p>Congratulations! You have withstood another year in this untamed land! Four years ago, you came here as refugees with only what you had on your backs, struggling to survive. Slowly, you began to build. You created a home. You began to hope. You overcame hardship and violence.</p>
    <p>The challenges are not done. The future is not certain. What is certain now is that you are on a path. You are no longer just surviving, you are beginning to thrive.</p>
    <p>There are still many ways that things could go wrong - many threats, internal and external, that could tear you and your allies apart. These dangers are real and perhaps greater than ever.</p>
    <p>The difference now is that you are beginning to see what the future might look like if you rise above them.</p>
    <p>In addition to your standard yearly skill point, you have also gained a point of Refresh! It may be exchanged for a new stunt at this time.</p>
    <p>Per our discussion, you may use the following stunt:</p>
    <p><b>Elf Prime:</b> River elves are blood in the elven body. Their mastery of trade and networking, as well as the independent nature of the flotillas, allows them to maintain a flow of trade goods far more complex than others could manage.</p>
    <p>Once per turn, the river elves may motivate their economic track without spending a fate point. This may only be done to allow a cooperative Trade check with an allied elven nation with Elf Express. If the other nation does not agree to perform the check cooperatively or Elf Express cannot be used, this stunt cannot be used.</p>
    <p>A single flotilla cannot use this stunt to perform more than one Trade check in a single turn. If the first check on the Economy track is also a trade check, the Elf Prime motivated Trade check must be performed by a separate flotilla.</p>
    <p>This stunt can be used in tandem with Motivation from a separate source, such as spending a fate point.</p>
