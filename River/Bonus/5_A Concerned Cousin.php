    <h1>A Concerned Cousin</h1>
    <p>Terje has looked over the after action report dozens of times, and here he sits reading it again. His office was always kind of sparse, but now he has moved any unnecessary furniture to the edges of the small room or removed it entirely. Just a couple of chairs and his filing system now. Got to have clear lines of sight.</p>
    <p><i>They were good enough to get around the Cryptids, and they were looking for me…</i></p>
    <p>He hasn't had the courage to go back to his apartment. He glances up to make sure his door is still locked. He glances down at his report again. He has lost his place. He starts reading it again, from the beginning. </p>
    <p>Litoria is not used to proper doors anymore.  The raft she shares with her cousin has none.  What is the proper etiquette again?  Right.  Announce your presence.  Do not just walk right in.  She debates internally a moment.</p>
    <p>And knocks.</p>
    <p>Terje jumps slightly at the noise. He steps up to the door and places a hand on the latch. As he is standing to the side with a hand on his sword hilt, he realizes he is getting paranoid. He relaxes slightly, unlatches his door, and opens it.</p>
    <p>"Hello?"</p>
    <p>Litoria tries not to look too intimidating, but this effect is not particularly effective when she’s standing in her field armor having come directly from drills with the Eels.  She wishes Sauver could fit in the fort’s narrow hallways.</p>
    <p>“Terje?”  She makes the effort to pronounce her cousin’s partner’s name correctly, and comes close.  “You’re not busy, non?”</p>
    <p>"Litoria?" He blinks, briefly considering she might be another disguised spy, then shakes his head, "Uh, no. Come on in, please. Here…"</p>
    <p>He pulls two chairs out from a corner, notably not sitting behind his desk, "Just… close the door behind you, please."</p>
    <p>Litoria does as asked, and sits with a muffled clink of armor plates.  She leaves the spear at the door, and angles her chair to keep an eye on both.</p>
    <p>“You ‘ave read the report, non?” she looks gravely at the blade elf.</p>
    <p>He  glances at the report on his desk. The edges of the pages are already worn down from how many times he has flipped through it.</p>
    <p>"Yes," he relents, "More than once."</p>
    <p>“Mais la, you know then.”  Litoria nods, having decided something for herself.  “He trusts you, my cousin, your beau.”  She leans toward Terje, and places a webbed hand on his armored knee.  “We’ve all put <span class="tooltip">plein de<span class="tooltiptext">A lot</span></span> trust on you.  Ain’t fair, but it is what is.”</p>
    <p>Terje slumps his shoulders, "I know. Smilisca told me that… when we first got together. You know the flotilla is my second home. I wouldn't do anything to put you in danger. That and Smilisca made me promise never to write anything down. I keep it all in my head. They wouldn't have found anything."</p>
    <p>He takes a slow breath, "... Unless I had been home."</p>
    <p>“Mais,” Litoria pats his knee again and leans back, “if’n they’d wanted ya dere, don’tcha think you woulda been?”  She gives him a halfway crooked grimace that can’t quite be called a smile.  “Tha Skulk shore thought em competen’ ‘nuff.  Would be en big big <span class="tooltip">honte<span class="tooltiptext">Embarrassing</span></span> minnow mistake, weh?”</p>
    <p>“I…” Terje runs a hand through his hair, “Actually, yes, that is a very good point.”</p>
    <p>He slumps in his chair and places a hand on Litoria’s, “I’m sorry, ami. It got to me. I always thought of the cryptids as invincible, you know? They were always the secret ghost in our back pocket, something we could always rely on. And… now I know they’re just elves, like the rest of us. There were four of them when they tried to catch the spy at my door. Four! And he got away! Not only that, one of them almost died! Siiri told me how bad it was. If she hadn’t happened to be up late working on her medicines in the Fort, that cryptid wouldn’t have made it.”</p>
    <p>He pauses, “There was black blood on my door. Cryptids bleed black, did you know that?”</p>
    <p>Litoria thought better of confessing that she did not know that they actually do bleed.</p>
    <p>“Ami, mais - they’re elves, non?  All differen’ ways of bein’ en Elf er valid.”</p>
    <p>Terje nods, “I suppose that’s true. Yeah, and I’d rather have an elf watching my back than some… weird elflike shadow horror, or ghost, or eldritch monsters. Knowing they’re elves like us does make me feel better. I am sorry, I was rambling. I am just… a bit shaken. Odd, isn’t it? After all we went through… maybe I was just finally starting to feel safe.” </p>
    <p>Litoria had been all ready to complain and argue with this person who was targeted to potentially put her entire way of life and all the people who depend on her at risk.  Instead, she’s getting a pretty clear idea of what her cousin sees in the man.  She’s concerned for his well being.</p>
    <p>“Terje, ami ami,” Litoria sighs quietly, “we’re safest when we ken rely on each other.”</p>
    <p>“Weh,” Terje pronounces it like ‘whee,’ “Isn’t that the truth.”</p>
    <p>He pauses for a few moments, “I love him. I really do. A little more each time I see him.”</p>
    <p>Litoria looks at him seriously.</p>
    <p>“<span class="tooltip">Qu'il est amoureux.<span class="tooltiptext">He's in love.</span></span>  My cousin, mais he’s damaged.  He knows it too.”  She folds her hands in her lap.  “You’re good fer him, en he - he shouldn’ be bad fer you.  Don’ break each other's hearts, Terje.  It’d hurt more’n you’d think.”</p>
    <p>Terje gives a sly smile, “Well, then, the only way is forward. No way to go back now without the heartbreak. I don’t know where we’re going. I really don’t. Even a year ago, I didn’t know we were going to get this… serious. Ehra still needs me here, Katiin still needs me here… I can’t let my last family down. They’d be lost without me too. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I feel like I’m torn between two different  worlds and don’t want to give up either of them. I’m not going to give up, though. I’m going to keep trying. I promise. I swear on my terrible mutton chops.”</p>
    <p>Litoria laughs, despite herself.  It’s a bit rusty.</p>
    <p>“Luckily,” she gives him a sideways smile, “we’re <i>elves</i>.  Yall have plein de time.”</p>
    <p>“Weh,” He mispronounces it <i>again</i> in a completely different way, “But maybe not so much that I can’t let myself have a <i>little</i> time now. I think I’ll tell Ehra I need a few days off. Y’know, for the stress. And hey… Thanks, Litoria. I feel better.”</p>
    <p>“Le’ me know when you’ll be wantin’ to head over.  Sauver and I ken make it there right quick.”</p>
    <p>Terje smiles again, “See? No maps at all.”</p>
