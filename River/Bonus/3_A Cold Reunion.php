    <h1>A Cold Reunion</h1>
    <p>Litoria does not know what to expect. She knows that there’s a strange coincidence going on. Another light snowfall has dusted the area, much like the day she met the Stran- the werewo- the el-... Litoria loses her train of thought again.</p>
    <p>She resolves herself to navigating the river. She calms her mind by tracking the shoreline. She is looking for the spot at which she let the… where she last saw Bryti. The note had to have been from her. It was from her, right? Who else would it be.</p>
    <p>She sees the narrow trough at which she dropped off her passenger. Sauver climbs onto the bank easily enough. The hippo slowly trundles inward. Litoria feels like a ball of tension. She’s not even sure what emotions she’s really feeling.</p>
    <p>A few dozen feet away from the river, concealed by a thick grove of pine trees, she sees a campfire. There is a figure in a fur-liked black cloak sitting at the fireplace, with her back towards Litoria. That ridiculous sword is still strapped to her. Litoria sees the figure’s long white hair and pointed ears. She realizes she’s holding her breath.</p>
    <p>She decides what to do. </p>
    <p>“Tiens, Stranger!” Litoria calls out.  Though there’s absolutely no way this could be any other elf, it’s better to err on the side of caution rather than using a name that was so carefully given.  She stops Sauver just outside the range of the campfire’s light.</p>
    <p>The figure stands up slowly, and appears to tuck something under the cloak.</p>
    <p>Bryti turns around. She has a very carefully measured expression on her face.</p>
    <p>“You came.” There is tension in her voice. </p>
    <p>“A’course I came.”  Litoria slides off Sauver’s side, planting the butt of her two-pronged spear in the cold dirt.  “My cousin axed me to.”</p>
    <p>Bryti visibly relaxes, “Well… don’t stand in the cold. Come.”</p>
    <p>She sits down on an old log near the fire, with plenty of space. </p>
    <p>Litoria’s webbed hand hesitates on the spear’s heavy haft.  If it trembles slightly when she lets go, she ignores it.  She sits near the fire, and pulls her alligator hides snug around her.  She wriggles her toes in the uncomfortable boots she’d picked up at Fort Alfyr.  This is not her comfort zone.  Nothing about this is easy.</p>
    <p>“Mais, they say you’re a werewolf then.  Issat for true?”</p>
    <p>Bryti turns her head towards Litoria, giving a careful look. </p>
    <p>“Yes.” She speaks quietly. </p>
    <p>“Twelve feet tall, breathin ice like some kinda white dragon?”</p>
    <p>Bryti snorts a laugh, “Not quite.”</p>
    <p>“A leas’ that were predictably exaggerated.”  She sighs.  How is it so easy to talk to her?  When so much of the Warmaster’s experience is screaming to just kill the monster now.  But this isn’t a monster.  “Why the sword then?  I though’ silver were en unholy thing to your lot, me.”</p>
    <p>“It is.” She responds.</p>
    <p>She gently unshrugs the sheathed sword off her back and sets it in her lap. She moves her hands slowly and in clear view. She places a hand on the hilt and lets it sit there for a few seconds. She gives Litoria an odd look, then slowly draws the blade and offers it towards Litoria, hilt first. </p>
    <p>Litoria stamps down the panic at seeing a werewolf drawing a weapon within reach while hers is braced in the dirt just beyond.  This is an elf.  A cousin.  Someone with a piece of Perfection to reflect.</p>
    <p>She accepts the sword carefully, and gently inspects its length, weight, balance.  She has a lot of practice with weapons.</p>
    <p>The sword actually feels… familiar? It’s a heavy blade already, but the weight has a certain… momentum to it. It takes her a moment to realize that it must have a very similar enchantment to her own spear.</p>
    <p>As she examines the blade, she notes the same runes that she had seen before. Interestingly, it is actual Silversheen, not just alchemical silver. She doesn’t understand the runes, but they are complex and layered. Possibly related to more than just the magic in the blade. There are images of a pair of wolves pacing opposite each other on the flats of the blade, and a holy symbol of Luna at the base. In the middle of the flat, there is an inscription in plain Skaplyndi: </p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter" class="center">Through my wrath and pain</p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter" class="center">I shall purge this wretched curse</p>
    <p id="BrytiLetter" class="center">The last trace of us</p>
    <p>“I crafted it myself,” Bryti explains, “Had help with the magic. It is made with a purpose, a single one. The runes and holy symbol, they contain the evil in the silver. The poem… is a reminder of the purpose.”</p>
    <p>Litoria contemplates this in silence a moment.</p>
    <p>She stands, and retrieves her polearm, then hands it to Bryti.  To let her see the similarity in the magic.</p>
    <p>“This purpose?”  She hesitates, still holding the sword.  “It have anythin’ to do with beheading humans an carvin runes in em?”</p>
    <p>Bryti hesitates before touching the spear. She gives the silversheen head a skeptical look, but takes the weapon anyway. She feels the heft of the weapon, and gives an appreciative nod, though her expression looks very troubled.</p>
    <p>“Not humans,” she answers quietly, “Afflicted.”</p>
    <p>“Esplains that.”  And Litoria is torn as to what to ask next.  She has so many questions.  She shelves this line of thought to pick back up on later.  Other questions need to be answered first.  She tries to picture the list she’s been working on, and almost wishes she’d brought that slip of paper with her.</p>
    <p>“Mais, <span class="tooltip">pour la vérité<span class="tooltiptext">For the truth</span></span>, do you consider yourself an elf?  A cousin?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” she does not hesitate in her answer, “My father was a blade elf. My mother was a werewolf. They… they loved each other. Were married. Did not care what others thought about that, they…” She stumbles over her words, then stops.</p>
    <p>“My mother may have raised me as a Lycan,” She resumes, “But my father raised me as a blade elf. I am both.”</p>
    <p>She muffles a quiet laugh, “Where else would I learn to use an absurd weapon like that?”</p>
    <p>Litoria almost laughs.  It’s a fair point.  “All differen’ ways of bein’ en Elf...” she mutters to herself.</p>
    <p>“How far’ve you come to git here?”  She passes a thumb over the unfamiliar runes.  “En why here?”</p>
    <p>"I've come… a very long way. I'm from a town called Novarsk. In the northwestern mountains. Haven't been back in… over fifteen years. Not since…" She trails off.</p>
    <p>"Since then, I've been hunting. One group of afflicted to the next. Only the worst, those that have given themselves over to it. Those I could never save."</p>
    <p>She grits her teeth. "Luna and her stars guide me to where I need to be to find the next group. That's what guided me here, hunting a group of afflicted. Those humans. There are… always more, and I will keep hunting them until I…" She bites that sentence off.</p>
    <p>"Until we monsters haunt your people no more. That is why I am here."</p>
    <p>Litoria touches a hand to the scars on her face, tight and starting to ache in the dry cold air.  It wasn’t a monster that put those scars there and pushed her to join the rebellion.  Those were the actions and choices of Men.  She’s crossed the continent for those choices.  She sits with the naked sword across her knees, allowing the cold bite of metal to keep her in the present.  Wet and furry ghosts drag at her thoughts.  </p>
    <p>“How ken I help?”  Litoria turns the blade around, and offers it back to Bryti, hilt first.  “Weh, jus’ let me know whatchu need.”  It’s not absolution, to aid one werewolf in the destruction of others.  But perhaps it is a step in the right direction to just acknowledge the fragment of Perfection in one Elf.  Litoria straightens her spine and tries not to let the flashback’s echo show in her face.</p>
    <p>“The sword is my burden to bear,” Bryti places her hand on the hilt of the blade, but doesn’t take it back quite yet, “You can’t come with me. You have too many responsibilities here. The flotilla needs you, you can’t go off hunting werewolves and risking your life with some crazy fool. I… don’t think I should go to the flotilla, either. It would put you… the entire flotilla in danger. If the other elves found out you were intentionally hiding me, I don’t know what they’d do.”</p>
    <p>Bryti slowly takes the sword back and returns it to the sheath. She leans the blade on the log next to her, then turns Litoria’s spear to hand it back to her.</p>
    <p>“But… I need someone I can trust.”</p>
    <p>Litoria runs a webbed hand along the smooth wood of her ‘stick’s sturdy haft thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria leans the heavy spear against her shoulder.  “Cousine, er’ryone’s got to have someone.  I ain’t gon’ tell noone bout you.”  She sits in thoughtful silence a moment.  “Thems up in Surt.  I seen wolf tracks en signs of groups of people campin on their stinky lake.  The Hunger axed my help on a project makin a paralyzin’ poison to figh’ what he thinks is werewolves.  If’n you go back up that way, be watchin out for him an his.  It’s gon’ be a whole nest uh cottonmouths up thar for a long while.  I hear thar’s a rumor that he’s ‘flicted himself, me.  I don’ believe it, what’n there bein’ plenty uh wolfsbane ‘round, en ‘course he’d know what the righ’ proper response to that’d be.  Ya don’ get troo a war like’n that without comin’ up wi’ a procedure, non.”</p>
    <p>Bryti frowns somewhat, “I had no intention of going back to Surt. They made their opinion on me quite clear, and they’re entitled to it. Wolf tracks… can’t be the group I was tracking, they traveled in human form. I don’t know who it could be, but there’s a strong chance they’re a threat. Hunger is right to take precautions. As for the Hunger himself…”</p>
    <p>She smirks, “I overreacted when I bit him. I know that. It was satisfying to shut him up, though. Regardless, if he downed a bunch of wolfsbane it’s his loss. He was never in any danger. I… well, I guess the secrets of a dead empire don’t matter all that much. My role is more than just a choice, it’s a sacred duty only a few are called to. I was, and in the process of that I was blessed by Luna. I no longer carry the affliction.” </p>
    <p>Litoria sits on that thought for a moment before cracking a bit of a grin.</p>
    <p>“I bet he done scared himself real sick, me.  That Hunger, he <span class="tooltip">de’pouille<span class="tooltiptext">A word for anything or anyone who is a mess</span></span> foh shore.”  But the fleeting smile passes quickly.  “Gods are mad <span class="tooltip">folle<span class="tooltiptext">Crazy (feminine)</span></span>.  Tain’t nuthin else for it an that’s done proof.”</p>
    <p>She takes a deep breath and considers her next words very carefully.</p>
    <p>“You done called yourself a monster, Bryti.  En I seen monsters - them ‘flicted they ain’t right no more.  But I seen plenty of Lycans.”  And that thing in their eyes as they drown is not an animal’s panic or a monster’s simple madness.  Litoria doesn’t put voice to her inward horrors.  “An what I came all this way to fight weren’t ‘cause of some monstrous nature - it were fer the choices made by Men.”</p>
    <p>Bryti turns away from Litoria for a few seconds, “Yes it was. Choices made by people like me. Litoria, I haven’t lied to you once but I haven’t told you the full truth. I asked you to trust me, and you deserve to know. My family was loyal to the empire. My mother was a Skati.” She does not turn to look back at Litoria.</p>
    <p>“I ken be pretty certain her name wuddn’t Ars Khafra, the were-crocodile whose orders done got my face smashed movin’ rocks that ne’er belong’d in no swamp, non?”  Litoria reaches out as if to place her palm on the other woman’s shoulder and then thinks better of it.  “There were many good years a’fore we got yoked to that <span class="tooltip">saleau<span class="tooltiptext">Sloppy, dirty old man</span></span> wi’ no way out.  I ‘member how we done celebrated meetin’ the Empire a’ first.  It done connected us to a much bigger worl’, it did.  An much as I want ta go home, I ain’t gon regret the leavin’, me.  It were the right thing to do.”</p>
    <p>“I should learn Sylvan,” Bryti has turned back towards Litoria with a faint smile on her face, “You sound like my mother. I know we did… many things our empire made brought greatness to the world. Brought people together, created great works, spread knowledge and language…”</p>
    <p>The smile vanishes, “We also brought slavery, genocide, and oppression everywhere we went. People like me allowed it to happen, made excuses… my mother always said we could fix the empire’s problems from the inside. Instead, the empire we created allowed men like Dreyrugr to flourish, and my mother…” She falls silent again.</p>
    <p>“Litoria, I have a question for you,” She takes a slow breath, “And I know it will be a painful one for us both, but I have to know. Were you there when the lost legion was destroyed?”</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria shudders, and can’t hide it.  Sauver bulls her way closer to the fire and pushes her massive head against Litoria’s back.  Litoria takes the support that’s given by her emotional support hippopotamus as it is deeply necessary when talking about this <i>specific</i> subject.  Even before the events at Skaplyndi she was haunted by what happened in that cold Northern swamp.  </p>
    <p>“Weh, I was there, me.”  She looks up at the silvered tines of her heavy spear and wishes she’d had it then.  The smooth wood shaft is a comforting thing to hold - it feels nothing at all like wet fur.</p>
    <p>“Hello Sauver,” Bryti lightly touches the hippo’s neck, “It’s good to see you too.”</p>
    <p>Bryti doesn’t respond for a few moments, giving perhaps both of them a little time.</p>
    <p>“My brother died there,” she whispers, “Litoria… I knew that when I accepted your offer to travel with the flotilla the first time. You took the only option we gave you, the actions we forced you into. It took me time to understand that, but I do now. I… just had to know.”</p>
    <p>“Litoria…” Bryti sees that Litoria is not looking at her. Bryti’s hand moves, hesitates for a moment, and settles on Litoria’s shoulder gently, “You’re not a monster.”</p>
    <p>Sometimes it feels like she will never rinse the stink of blood and urine from her skin.  That visceral fear haunts Litoria’s waking dreams.  It’s not forgiveness, but it’s something.  She sobs quietly and leans slowly toward that hand on her shoulder, but turns and grasps Sauver’s snout before her murdering hands can wrap around another werewolf’s neck.  Long minutes pass before she can speak again.  And she’s so very grateful for Bryti’s letting that silence pass.</p>
    <p>“I left family in that swamp too.  It were a special hell.”  Litoria needs both hands to count her deceased siblings - she’s the last of six.  “Left the rest on the field ‘aside Skaplyndi.”  And there, the other kind of hell, the one with a sound like thunder and a different hippo in her care.  “It were our choices that put us in tha channel.  An we were used badly for et.”</p>
    <p>Litoria looks to the fire, burned down now to glowing coals.</p>
    <p>“Don’ use yerself up for someone else, Bryti.  You don’ deserve ta be wasted.”</p>
    <p>Bryti closes her eyes and does not respond to that request. Her hand doesn't leave Litoria's shoulder. She sits for a few moments before glancing back up at the fire </p>
    <p>"I'd better get that built up again. It's only going to get colder."</p>
    <p>She gives Litoria a look before standing, her hand moving away slowly when she's certain Litoria is steady. Bryti moves a few more small chunks of firewood onto the fire and slowly builds it back up.</p>
    <p>"I normally don't make a fire, as, well, a wolf doesn't need one. I've been making them hoping you would find me. I don't know how long you traveled to get here or when you, but tonight is going to get quite cold. Being on the water's a bad idea. We can keep the fire going, and I'll be just fine. Here…"</p>
    <p>She unbuckles the fur cloak and sits next to Litoria, "Novarsk got a lot colder than this. I can stay in my elven body, I… Well, I'll be warm enough. This should keep you warm enough. Will you stay?"</p>
    <p>Litoria edges slowly away from the fur cloak and pulls her alligator skins close.  Sauver flops onto the ground with a heavy thud.  Litoria carefully lays her long spear on the ground and turns to open Sauver’s saddlebags.</p>
    <p>“You are not wantin’ me to touch fur.”</p>
    <p>Her voice is low, her tone serious, and if there’s a bit of a crack as she tries to hide the hurt of it, she doesn’t call attention to it.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know how long I’d be lookin fer ya, me.”  Litoria takes out a stitched leather tent.  “I thought I migh’ hafta wait a bit.  I e’en borrowed boots jus’ in case.  I’ll stay.”</p>
    <p>The tent is large enough to cover two elves and a hippo somewhat larger than Sauver is now.  In the field, Litoria would have been expected to have a partner on patrol.  And Sauver has yet to grow completely into the war harness.</p>
    <p>Bryti looks at the fur cloak, then at Litoria's hands. She neatly folds the cloak and leaves it on the log. She stands and watches Litoria unfold the large tent.</p>
    <p>"Well," She folds her arms, "That's… quite a bit nicer than a lean-to under a pine. I wish I had a Sauver. Here, let me help you set it up." </p>
    <p>“I wish ya had a <span class="tooltip">sauver<span class="tooltiptext">Verb: to save</span></span> too.”  Her words are quiet, almost too low to be heard.  Litoria accepts the help, and with some rope they are able to set up the tent, anchored by the hippopotamus and open on one side to the fire.  It’s much warmer than sitting in the open.</p>
    <p>As the evening begins to roll in, they get settled for the evening without saying much. The two sit in silence with Sauver for some time. As dark begins to roll in, Bryti finally says something.</p>
    <p>"I didn't think you would come. Thank you." </p>
    <p>“A’course I came,” Litoria repeats, “My cousin axed.”  And she smiles.  It’s a genuine smile in the comfortable dim light of the fire.</p>
    <p>“If’n you need anything, just tell me.”  Litoria leans toward Bryti until their shoulders touch.  “You run into more ‘en you can handle, I’ve got your backup.  Wi’ what for you face - you migh’ have need of en army.  Are numbers a lil bit low, but we’ll answer your call ta arms if’n ya give it.”</p>
    <p>“An don’ protes’.  Come Spring we’re settin up Goldfall River, en will be in Crater Lake till Fall.  We’re wintering not far from here, just North up the coast from Ft. Alfyr.  Next Spring we’re heading up Goldfall again toward Asavardi.  Year after, probably a round toward Surt en the dropoff site for the Crag Elves.”</p>
    <p>Bryti leans into Litoria slightly and shakes her head with a real, actual smile on her face, "Someday, Litoria, I will figure out why you are so kind to me. I… if I bite off more than I can chew, I'll come and find you. I promise you that. Or maybe if I just get…"</p>
    <p>She pauses, "... lonely."</p>
    <p>She lets that sit.</p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Litoria smiles quietly.</p>
    <p>The two stay silent.</p>
    <p>Outside, a thin layer of  snow covers a folded fur cloak and a sheathed silver sword left leaning against the log.</p>
