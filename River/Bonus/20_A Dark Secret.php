    <h1>A Dark Secret</h1>
    <p id="i">We’re ready. Tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Ink, of course, could not be bothered to give a specific time. An assumption of “probably sometime at night” proves correct when Ink appears just after sunset. He picks up the group one by one, with typically minimal conversation.</p>
    <p>As he picks up Amenidal, the last member of the group, he turns and addresses the group he has gathered.</p>
    <p>“Taking you somewhere secret,” he explains, “There will be rules. You will stay close to me. You will create no light and cast no spells. You will not try to determine where you are. You will not speak to anyone unless spoken to.”</p>
    <p>He pauses before continuing, “You will be safe. I promise.”</p>
    <p>“Also there’s tea,” Fury comments.</p>
    <p>Ink gives her a sideways glance.</p>
    <p>“Keeps it welcoming, really,” she adds with a smile.</p>
    <p>With those somewhat unnerving rules out of the way, Ink casts his final teleport spell.</p>
    <p>You arrive somewhere dark. Those in the group with darkvision can see a dense jungle floor and the edges of massive trees at the edge of your vision. You stand in a large dirt circle, with a pathway leading away from it. The pathway appears clean and cultivated, with flat river stones marking the way. Otherwise, it is pitch dark.</p>
    <p>With low light, you can see extremely dim light filtering down through what seems to be a dense triple layer canopy of jungle above. Around you, you can see the outlines of huge trees. Along their trunks there are huge bulbous protrusions. You aren’t sure, but around them there may be movement, and you feel like you are being watched.</p>
    <p>Anasatri and Fury, who have neither low light vision nor darkvision, cannot see their hand in front of their faces. Thankfully the other elves are kind enough to help guide them along the path that Ink guides you down.</p>
    <p>After a minute or two of walking down the path, Ink leads the group to a small building. The structure appears to be growing out of the tree itself, with round windows opening to outside. A dim glow emits from the windows, the only real light you’ve seen so far.</p>
    <p>Skulk is waiting, leaning against the structure with her arms folded. She watches the group silently as they walk up a short set of stairs into what you can now see is a small cottage.</p>
    <p>Inside, the cottage is surprisingly humble. Currently, it is lit only with a few small candles and the dull glow from some coals in a firepit. The room has only a few simple pieces of furniture, all of which appear to be growing directly out of the floor. There is a small cooking area with a metal box over the firepit, and in a far corner there is a desk piled with writing utensils, tattoo tools, vials of ink, and scrolls.</p>
    <p>Still is sitting quietly on one of the benches near the firepit. Shine is standing with his back to the group, pouring something out of a small copper teapot. Ink leads the group in, then goes and sits next to Still. The cryptic cleric puts her hand on Ink’s shoulder and leaves it there. As the group enters, Skulk quietly closes the door behind them and leans against the wall.</p>
    <p>Shine turns around. He has a simple platter with a few hot mugs of tea, each with a small sprig of cinnamon resting in it. He offers it to the group.</p>
    <p>“Thank you all for coming,” he speaks in one of his prepared speeches, “We greatly appreciate the discretion you have shown so far, and mutual trust we have accomplished. It will be difficult for Ink to prepare himself for what he is about to tell you. It will take him perhaps ten to fifteen minutes before he is ready to speak. In the meantime, please enjoy your tea and let me know how I may assist you.” </p>
    <p>Smilisca thinks to himself that the fancy magic-grown furniture isn’t even practical.  You can’t move the chairs.  His sips his tea to hide his expression of grump.</p>
    <p>Anasatri is bouncing rapidly between nerves and excitement, and even she isn’t sure which she’s feeling at the moment. She couldn’t see anything outside, but the smell and sound of a forest was still deeply familiar to her, even years after growing up in one. She accepts the tea with a smile, looking around curiously. </p>
    <p>Steve sticks close to Anasatri, not saying anything. He quietly drinks his tea with apparent enjoyment.</p>
    <p>Fury sips quietly at her mug, enjoying the chance to actually savor the tea this time.</p>
    <p>Amenidal quietly and carefully examines all of the elves that have been gathered for this before he lets his eyes fall to the tea in his hands.  He takes his time drinking it, he is familiar with what Ink is having to do.</p>
    <p>A fair amount of time passes in silence. Even Shine doesn’t prompt anyone to speak without necessity. Respectful of Ink’s need to gather himself, the group remains quiet, only sipping their tea. It is almost cold by the time Ink speaks.</p>
    <p>"I'm ready," Ink finally says.</p>
    <p>He turns to face the group, but he still seems hesitant. Still squeezes his shoulder. She scoots forward in her chair and unclasps the holy symbol from her neck.</p>
    <p>She holds her broken mirror in her hands gently. She unclips something from the back and removes the silver ring from the edge.</p>
    <p>Without the frame holding it together, the pieces of shattered mirror fall to the table with a clatter. Ink looks down at them. He quietly reaches forward and places a hand over the scattered shards. He waits several more moments before speaking.</p>
    <p>"When She left…" Ink's voice is much clearer than usual, though he has a distant tone, "We were so happy. She had set out for us, to bring us Her greatest gift. How could we feel anything else? She was a Goddess. She was perfect, infallible, and She loved us so very much. How could we possibly doubt Her? How could we possibly think She was making a mistake?"</p>
    <p>"We were going to be immortal. We were going to be perfect. We rejoiced and revelled. No one had the slightest fear, slightest hesitation… except for me."</p>
    <p>"Something was… was wrong. Something did not add up. Kept having… dreams. Can't say it was logic. Gut instinct. Dread. A feeling I could not shake."</p>
    <p>"I was Inkeriseus. One of the first true wizards. I practiced magic that predated the written word. I was known as the most brilliant among the elves. A master of divination, and of the unknown. I believed myself infallible. I believed myself capable of second guessing a Goddess. I was wrong, and I was right. I did something incredibly foolish."</p>
    <p>"I <a href="">cast a scry</a>, into the future. To the moment when Calestros would return. That vision… nearly broke me. The fallout alone destroyed my lab and nearly killed my sister, but it worked… I knew the Shatter was coming, as much as any mortal can possibly comprehend it."</p>
    <p>"I was the first one who believed him," Skulk speaks from behind the group, "He's my brother, and he's an idiot… but I trust him. Others didn't. Look… Ink's always been weird. He already had, uh, a reputation. People called him insane. They called him an idiot. Called him a heretic. Me too. Tried to convince people, but… it wasn't going well. Didn't convince many."</p>
    <p>"Shiraskulkina <i>did</i> convince me," Shine adds, "I was Shinerias. I was among the most beautiful of all elves, and had many friends and the ears of many important people. I was able to convince many more. Ayastillyen was the first priestess we convinced of the coming catastrophe. Her assistance gave us much credibility. We convinced many that disaster would return with our Mother, but far from all. A few thousand, in all. Less than half of our tribe. Some of the ones we could not convince were the people closest to us, people we loved, but we were running out of time. We had to act."</p>
    <p>"But what could we do?" Ink speaks again,"How do you escape the mistake of a Goddess. She is us, and we are Her. Part of reality, part of identity. Could not run away from Her any more than you could run from your own skin."</p>
    <p>"I had been experimenting with the plane of shadow. Studying it. Taking brief excursions, few days at a time. Became aware that there were… other places connected to shadow. Places where the rules were different. Different realities. Thought maybe… maybe if I put enough reality between us and the shatter it would shield us."</p>
    <p>"Out of time. Had to act. I opened a portal to the plane of shadow. Brought us through. Guided us as deep as I could into Shadow, searching for safety, went further than ever before… and then it happened."</p>
    <p>"The sound…" Still speaks so quietly it can barely be perceived.</p>
    <p>"It cannot be described," Ink continues, "Not by mortal language. It tore across reality like a shockwave. That… <i>force</i> hit us and drove us away, cast us deeper into Shadow. Flung us to places I did not understand, could not comprehend… Shadow did not stop it… but it did shield us."</p>
    <p>"We… were not torn asunder as other elves were. I did not know where we were. We searched for a way back, but could not see. Shadow twisted our minds and bodies as we searched realities unknown for a way back. We did not find it, but with time, we learned that our Mother had succeeded."</p>
    <p>"As Shadow softened the shatter, it allowed us to receive Her gift. We found that we do not fall victim to the ravages of time. Though Shadow changed us, we persisted. We have been searching Shadow ever since the Shatter, seeking reality after reality, trying to find the right one… some so close to our own it took decades or centuries to learn they were not ours, but… now…"</p>
    <p>Ink glances up at Amendial, "... we have found it. Found evidence. Answers. This is where we came from. We have returned. Those we left behind are long gone, but… we are finally home… and I don't know what to do." </p>
    <p>Anasatri’s wings thump to the floor beside her, “You...you were there…?” She trails off and takes a very large gulp of her now-cold tea. </p>
    <p>Shine looks at the stunned faces around the room and sighs. He stands up and begins preparing another pot of tea.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Ink answers quietly, "We were there when the Gods walked the world. We have met Calestros, knew her before…"</p>
    <p>Still closes her eyes. Several black tears roll down her face.</p>
    <p>"It…" Ink looks at her sadly, "... Is hard to talk about." </p>
    <p>Amenidal is also looking between the stunned faces before once more down at his now empty cup.  “It still hurts.  Always will.” </p>
    <p>“<i><small>Mais la...</small></i>” Smilisca sits hard on the floor. </p>
    <p>Anasatri abruptly stands up, setting her mug to the side. She takes a few steps toward Ink and stops abruptly, holding out her arms, “Ink...may I…?”</p>
    <p>Ink simply nods. </p>
    <p>Anasatri simply hugs him tight, silent. When she steps back, she glances at Still, ears and wings low, “I’m so sorry, I can’t...I hear Her sometimes...I...is it...may I?” She holds out her arms again. </p>
    <p>Still doesn't say anything. Instead, she leans over and accepts the hug quietly. Still leans a head on Anasatri's shoulder.</p>
    <p>"I can't remember her face," Still speaks so quietly only Anasatri can hear her. </p>
    <p>Anasatri bites back a sudden sob and just hugs her tight. </p>
    <p>Fury takes another sip from her mug. A trickle of steam escapes from the side of her mouth. "...And that's why you have to keep everything a secret," she says, staring at Ink. "You're too... close. There's too much tied into what you represent. What you are." She chuckles uncomfortably. "Even not including what some people would do to 'get' what they'd think you have, the burden of what your existence means... it'd be too much. For anyone, on either side of the equation." </p>
    <p>"Yes," Ink replies quietly, "If our secret was known… There would be many who would try to gain what we know… what we are. There are… very few of us. Cannot… cannot grow at… any real rate. Could stop many, but some would be violent. Eventually, one would get lucky, or simple attrition… may take time, but if our secret is revealed… only a matter of time." </p>
    <p>“And I can think of a few people who really shouldn’t know about you,” Fury says. “So what do we do?” </p>
    <p>"That's why I asked you," Ink gestures at the group, "Out of ideas. Warded us, gave protection, but… discovery still possible, especially with magic. And… we can't hide alone forever."</p>
    <p>"Shadow… drives a wedge. Makes us alien. Tries to drag us away, keep us separate… if we return to Shadow, turn away from our home, we would be Plevy… husks. Monsters. Not elves anymore. We must stay in the world… stay family."</p>
    <p>"It's been easier for me to talk," Skulk speaks up, "Ever since I started meeting people, and did stuff with you, Sparky. It's been easier."</p>
    <p>"Shadow detaches us," Ink adds, "Makes… communication hard. Different for all of us, but… the more we interact with our kin, the easier it gets."</p>
    <p>"Even my limited interaction has made it easier," Shine explains as he hands out another batch of tea, "We feel more like ourselves. We have discussed it among ourselves, and we are in agreement. We can't go back. We are part of this world, or we are nothing. All of us."</p>
    <p>"But every interaction, a risk," Ink adds, "We have… a great deal of time. That risk, eventually, will come to pass. We cannot go back, but to move forward… inevitably dooms us." </p>
    <p>Still next to the cleric, Anasatri murmurs, “We have a quiet place, if you think it might help you. Ink knows where I am, if you ever want to come.” </p>
    <p>Still nods to Anasatri quietly. </p>
    <p>She hesitantly speaks up, “If...the secret is doomed to come out eventually, then would it be best to decide yourself how it should come out? Before you run out of time and it gets out of your control?” </p>
    <p>“Mais, ‘er make it irrelevant.”  Smilisca shrugs.  “You done mentioned attrition more ‘en once.  Engage more ‘en destroy th’ mystery.”</p>
    <p>Fury nods. “Or try to remove the secrets that are most likely to get everyone’s attention.” </p>
    <p>“Weh.”  Smilisca snorts.  “Maybe a little less of the showin’ off.  Show some’a <i>humilité.</i>”</p>
    <p>"Yeah…" Skulk mutters, "I've been trying to get him to put a shirt on for ten thousand years. <i>Good luck.</i>" </p>
    <p>Ink gives her a sideways look.</p>
    <p>“Does it…” Anasatri pauses, turning one of her many bracelets, specifically, the one they all share, made of dark wood beads and vines. “Is it just talking, that you’ve noticed? Does interacting help with the other changes the shadow plane made?” </p>
    <p>"I didn't mean 'stop showing off'!" Fury says quickly, waving her arms. "But I mean… like what Satri is talking about. Can we reduce some of the more obvious problems, like the influence of the plane of Shadow? Or… immortality."</p>
    <p>"Don't know," Ink admits, "Have only just now noticed the talking…"</p>
    <p>"Perfection is a lie," Still whispers. Ink looks at her before continuing.</p>
    <p>"We… were Shattered too, only in a different way," he explains, "We cannot go back any more than you can…" </p>
    <p>Smilisca points one webbed finger at Fury.</p>
    <p>“Non, mais that’s a lie,” he argues.  “Figure out <i>that</i> change an you’ll find somewhat solution.”</p>
    <p>Fury slumps in her chair. “...I’m pretty sure we don’t want a repeat of that,” she says. “There were several steps involved that we should skip. And never talk about.” </p>
    <p>“Ain’t sayin’ they should light up the place.”  Smilisca puts his mug down carefully.  “Mais, you got’s admit.  You did change a big big lot, weh.  An’ that’s proof what change is possible.”</p>
    <p>“Change… inevitable.” Steve says carefully.  “All of us, connected.”  He tilts his head.  “Weave our futures.  Near us, affects you.  Dye wicking up thread.”  He pauses again, clearly fighting for words.  “Shattering.  Made us all pieces.  You, out of world, still a piece.  Tried to cut small mirror from the rest-- still old mirror.”  He takes a deep breath, then shakes his head, unable to say more at the moment. </p>
    <p>"But…" Ink grumbles and looks around the room, "We're… so different. We are… horrible to look upon, we couldn't…" Ink very suddenly stops talking and looks at the table in front of him.</p>
    <p>Skulk rubs her temples.</p>
    <p>"... could they… could you accept us?" Ink asks. </p>
    <p>Steve’s head tilts the other way.  “Different, yes.  Horrible, no.”  He gets up and wanders over, arms open in offer of hug. Ink accepts quietly.</p>
    <p>Skulk groans and mutters, "Here we go…" </p>
    <p>Steve and his offer of hug move to her next. Skulk stares at Steve for several seconds. She opens her mouth with a sneer slightly, but then closes it. </p>
    <p>"... Really?" She asks. </p>
    <p>Steve nods solemnly.  “Not required.  If scared.  Or not comfortable.” </p>
    <p>"No, I…" Skulk pauses. She steps forward and accepts the hug.  Steve looks pleased.</p>
    <p>"Thanks…" she mutters. </p>
    <p>“Welcome!” Steve chirps. He wanders in Shine’s direction next. Shine briefly starts launching into some kind of obtuse prepared speech, but just shuts up after a few syllables and lets Steve hug him. He seems surprised.</p>
    <p>A small warm smile is spreading on Amenidal’s face as he watches.  “<span class="tooltip">Vidíš?<span class="tooltiptext">You see?</span></span>” he whispers softly to himself, “<span class="tooltip">Ste všetky krásne.<span class="tooltiptext">You are all beautiful.</span></span>” </p>
    <p>That statement seems to be too much for Ink to handle. He slumps back on the chair, lowers his shoulders, and looks around the room in shock.</p>
    <p>"<span class="tooltip">Možno tomu verím...<span class="tooltiptext">I may believe that.</span></span>" he says very quietly.</p>
    <p>"Shadow drives a wedge…" Shine speaks solemnly, "Not just between us and other elves, but between ourselves. We… find it hard to look at eachother as we are. Look at our own faces. It is… difficult for us to…" he stumbles for words momentarily, "Hard for us to see." </p>
    <p>Anasatri nods, “Maybe that’s one of the things that would get easier with time too?” She grimaces, “Er, not time. Interactions. Acceptance, I think, would be the <i>least</i> problem.” She pauses for a moment and glances at Ink, “You’d said before that...my type of magic worried you. Because it can reach past your protections, and isn’t quite...in my control. I could use that to try to find possible answers for you. But,” she holds up a hand, “I won’t if you aren’t alright with it. All of you.” </p>
    <p>"Everyone is here because we all agreed to it," Shine has found a script he prepared, "You are trusted. We discussed the options for weeks before deciding who to allow. You have our full cooperation, and we understand you may learn much about us as a result. So long as you don't share it with the outside world, we will agree to it."</p>
    <p>"Here <i>because</i> we need that kind of magic…" Ink manages to add quietly, "Need to account for it." </p>
    <p>Anasatri nods and smiles over at Steve, “Want to try to help me? You apparently did the impossible once already.” </p>
    <p>Steve shrugs and nods.</p>
    <p>"There is more," Ink adds, with his voice returning slightly, "A resource."</p>
    <p>"You're sure?" Skulk asks.</p>
    <p>Ink nods.</p>
    <p>"An archive," he says, "Knowledge we gained traveling Shadow. Some from other planes, other realities. Some even from before we left. All… copies of copies, originals long gone but… has knowledge found nowhere else." </p>
    <p>There is a very small high pitched sound as Anasatri claps her hands over her mouth to muffle her excitement, all of her feathers on end. “<small>No <i>wonder</i> you liked my library idea!</small>”</p>
    <p>While he is not making a noise like Anasatri, Amenidal is also perked up more with wide excited eyes.  He did not in fact know that part.  “Different rules…” he mutters in thought. </p>
    <p>Steve wiggles excitedly, then pauses.  “Food limits.  When?”</p>
    <p>"Long time ago," Ink thumbs his chin, "One of the first changes. Shadow… tries to take from us, things that made us… like others. Tries to make us alien, unable to relate. Same reason we cannot sleep, cannot dream." </p>
    <p>“But you remember still,” Anasatri says quietly. </p>
    <p>"Remember it," Ink nods, "Miss it. Keep it in mind. Like the smell of tea…"</p>
    <p>Steve considers this.  “Exposure?  Better if not in shadow?”</p>
    <p>"Don't know," Ink admits, "Would be… nice. Miss tea."</p>
    <p>"Hey I found a way to get-" Skulk starts.</p>
    <p>"<i>No,</i>" Ink interrupts. </p>
    <p>"Could try," Steve muses. "...Asked Calestros?"</p>
    <p>The whole room falls silent for a minute.</p>
    <p>"That is… extremely difficult for us," Shine is the only one who manages to speak. </p>
    <p>Anasatri is nodding, looking more animated, “We can try! Steve was trying to poke me and might have accidentally fallen into a god’s dreamscape so contacting Calestros the uh, normal way should be doable.” She pauses, “The answer though, um…but we can try!”</p>
    <p>"Fallen into a <i>what?</i>" Ink looks up at Anasatri. </p>
    <p>“That’s um, the working theory? He <i>thought</i> it was my dreamscape, since he was trying to contact me. But he got stuck there for two weeks, and I was definitely awake for most of that. And I have a...connection, so that was the logic leap?”</p>
    <p>"Oh," Ink says blandly, "If… you could, it might… help. It is… we still remember how She was before. To hear Her now is…" he trails off.</p>
    <p>"We still love Her," Still adds very quietly.</p>
    <p>"She loves you too." Steve manages with surprising clarity. "All of us." He offers a half smile. "Even… when we feel broken." He lapses into silence again.</p>
    <p>Smilisca <a href="../6_Creation Myths.php#Hylidae">understands.</a></p>
    <p>"Yes," Still barely manages to say. </p>
    <p>Steve is silent for several minutes, then leans towards Anasatri, making sure he has her attention before he speaks. He gestures at the Cryptid elves. "What. <i>Priorities.</i>" </p>
    <p>“Oh, of course.” Anasatri raises her voice, “The important question here is what <i>you</i> all want. What are your priorities, and goals? What do you want to change, or keep the same?” </p>
    <p>"Thank," Steve says softly, turning his attention back to the Cryptids… if that's the right name for them.</p>
    <p>"Need… a future," Ink also struggles to articulate, "A place to call home. Somewhere we know… our future will be safe."</p>
    <p>A knowing look passes between Ink and Still. They say nothing.</p>
    <p>"For the record," Skulk clears her throat, "Much as I agree with that, I <i>like</i> being an immortal avatar of shadow. It's fun. Won't just give that up."</p>
    <p>"We can never forget…" Still manages to say.</p>
    <p>"What… my friends are trying to say," Shine holds up a hand as he attempts to piece his scripts together, "Is that we have many priorities. An assurance that we have a future that does not end in our utter destruction is paramount. Some have grown accustomed to our altered forms and our unaging condition, and will strongly oppose the lack of it. We all wish to never forget where we come from."</p>
    <p>"Conditional," Ink notes, "Don't age, but… still breathe, still bleed, still die. Indefinite, not… immortal." </p>
    <p>Anasatri smiles a little at Ink, “See? Shadow didn’t take all the common things from you.”</p>
    <p>"Not yet…" Ink notes. </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>After the initial barrage of questions, the group decides they would like to see this archive. Ink is more than happy to oblige, as it seems that he has hit his daily limit on public speaking. He guides the group away from his home, deeper into the cryptid settlement.</p>
    <p>As he guides you further, it actually gets slightly brighter. Soon, you reach a clearing near the base of a large tree. Through a gap in the branches, moon and starlight filter through just enough to make out a large circular pool. Keen eyed mages can recognize it as a highly traditional scrying pool. Ink leads you past that to the tree itself. He places a hand on the trunk, causing a secret door made from thick vines to open.</p>
    <p>Inside it is pitch black until Ink taps the wall. A series of dim magic light stones worked into the walls light up, illuminating the interior of the tree. The entire thing has been opened up on the inside. Catwalks stretch up into the dark, far above where the lights reach. The entire interior of the tree is lined with row after row of scrolls and books, some made from bizarre materials and featuring strange designs. There must be thousands of records here, and every single one is something you could find literally nowhere else.</p>
    <p>"My archive," Ink gestures upwards.</p>
    <p>There is a solid thump as Anasatri sits down abruptly, staring upward in open awe. “Oh Ink…!” </p>
    <p>Ink looks back. He quietly points to a pile of silk pillows near the door. Anasatri appears to have missed them by about a foot. </p>
    <p>“Right...I’ll just...get out of the doorway here…” She scoots awkwardly over, still staring upward. </p>
    <p>“Are they split up into sections?” Fury asks, staring into the hollowed-out tree from the doorway. “Like, ‘this is a section for our universe’, ‘this is a section for a universe that’s mostly breakfast foods’? That sort of thing?”</p>
    <p>"Don't joke about that," Ink briefly narrows his eyes at Fury.</p>
    <p>He walks to the center of the room and taps a pile of tightly bound scrolls sitting on a desk.</p>
    <p>"Index," he explains. </p>
    <p>“<small>Pfoo-wee...</small>” Smilisca is impressed despite his best attempts to not be.  “Say.  You got any good maps in here?”  He wanders, careful not to touch the priceless bound books.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Ink answers, "May be… hard to read."</p>
    <p>“Mais I gotta see, weh.  It’s... There’s so much.”</p>
    <p>Steve stares upward, wide-eyed. </p>
    <p>“Maybe we should start with this plane, and work our way out,” Fury says. She starts channel a bit of light into her fingers, but tendrils of shadow bolt out of the wall near her. The cover her hand like a bundle of cold tar, snuffing out the light.</p>
    <p>"<i>Rules,</i>" Ink grumbles.</p>
    <p>He makes a motion with one hand and the offending substance dissipates. <span class="tooltip">He waves the other<span class="tooltiptext">Mage Hand</span></span> and a bundle of shadows in the shape of a hand pops one of the glowing stones off the wall and holds it in front of Fury. </p>
    <p>Anasatri slowly pulls herself back to her feet and wobbles toward the index, “Can I have one of those lights too, please? It’s just too dim for me to read without going cross-eyed.”</p>
    <p>From the doorway, Amenidal is staring upwards with alarmingly wide eyes and ears that are visibly vibrating.  “There’s… so much… you’ve seen so much…”</p>
    <p>He dances his way around everyone to take a look at the index in the center of the room and ends up next to Anasatri.  His hands hover over one of the scrolls but he doesn’t touch it yet. </p>
    <p>One of the lights floats down into Anasatri’s hands. Ink looks at Amenidal briefly, but doesn’t say anything. He puts a hand on the pile of index scrolls.</p>
    <p>“Take your time,” Ink says, “Nothing… too dangerous. Read what you want. Curiosity… is okay, but nothing leaves. Can come here when you want, just ask. Only… follow the  rules.” He glances sideways at Fury. </p>
    <p>Anasatri looks up at Ink, “I’d guess that divination is a pretty big section. That’s probably the best place for me to start. I...think I have some questions for you on that, at some point.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Ink says, with no noticeable intonation. </p>
    <p>“Look, I’m sorry, I’m just hot-blooded,” Fury says, hands on her hips. “Just be glad I haven’t embarrassed myself yet, or you’d end up drowning me in that stuff.” She grabs hold of the light stone, and begins scanning titles. “...Do any of these record the Shadow Plane itself? Or maybe a timetable on the change?”</p>
    <p>There is a very long pause before Ink answers.</p>
    <p>“Were not able to keep records for… some time after we were lost. Much on the shadow plane, but… only noticed changes… very gradually.” He sounds like he’s struggling with those words. He points her in the direction of a large section of observations from the plane of Shadow.</p>
    <p>“Well, if I’m going to help you, I should probably try to understand you,” Fury says, walking over to the Shadow Section. “Which one of these is first?”</p>
    <p>"This one,” Ink says quietly.</p>
    <p>He walks over and touches one of the smaller scrolls on the shelf. Oddly, it doesn’t look older than most of the others.</p>
    <p>“Copied many times,” He explains, “First… first writing I was able to do. After. Fury..”</p>
    <p>Ink lowers his voice slightly, “Your magic… could hurt people here. Please be careful.” </p>
    <p>“I will,” Fury insists. She pulls the scroll delicately from its shelf. “The heat’s a little automatic sometimes. It’s like breathing; I can hold my breath, but it’s easy to forget about.” She glances at Ink. “...Are you sure ‘Shadow’ wasn’t a gift from Calestros, too? I know it doesn’t seem like one, but being a walking candle isn’t all it’s cracked up to be either. Maybe after a long enough time… I wouldn’t be much different.”</p>
    <p>She frowns. “I’m sorry; that’s probably very insensitive of me.”</p>
    <p>Ink looks at her for a long moment. He has a very contemplative look on his face, at least as much as she can read it.</p>
    <p>“If you could go back…” he finally asks, “Would you?” </p>
    <p>Fury snorts. “How far?”</p>
    <p>“To…” Ink closes his eyes and focuses a moment, “To… before you were a fire elf. Does it… feel like a gift to you?” </p>
    <p>“Surviving was. <i>Anyone else</i> surviving was. Being there in the first place?” She shakes her head. “Not really. If it was a gift, I certainly paid for it. And no amount of being a living chimney is going to change that.” She glances back at Ink. “If I could take it back from that moment? From the ritual? From Fau-- from <i>him</i> shoving a friend’s heart into my chest? Of course not; there was nothing else left. But before that? I think I would have liked to be just an elf for a while. Not a Fire Elf, or a Blade Elf, or anything.”</p>
    <p>“Barely remember it,” Ink responds surprisingly quickly as he looks at the scroll in her hand, “Copy of a copy…” </p>
    <p>“Well, maybe we should use the <i>Akashic Record</i>,” Fury says. “Get a fresh viewpoint.” She unrolls the scroll, and begins scanning it.</p>
    <p>“No,” Ink responds flatly. </p>
    <p>“Oh, yeah, you get to look at all of <i>my</i> embarrassing memories, but the minute <i>I</i> want to see something private on <i>you…</i>” She glances up, and smiles slightly. “I’m teasing. You don’t have to show me anything. Just remember -- if you need help, or its painful, you know how to find me.” </p>
    <p>“I do,” Ink replies.</p>
    <p>He touches the scroll in Fury’s hand. He stares at it for a few moments. He slowly turns to walk away. Suddenly, he stops.</p>
    <p>“Thanks,” he says before he moves away. </p>
    <p>“You’re welcome, Ink,” she says, turning back to the scroll.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>A few hours later, Satri slowly glides down from one of the upper levels. The pile of pillows is very welcome; she had known this was coming, and had spent the day resting, but it’s still very late by her standards and she’s tired. </p>
    <p>As she flops onto the pillows for a rest, she spots Ink nearby and waves tiredly, “This is amazing, thank you so much for letting me come here.” She looks up into the dimness, “It’s so much like home. Well, what was home. Our forest. I didn’t really know how much I’d missed the trees.”</p>
    <p>“We missed them too,” Ink says. </p>
    <p>“Is that how most elves used to live? In trees? We have some stories, you know, distant places, different people, but nothing sure.” She leans back on her hands, still looking up. “We were never sure, since falling is...a problem for most other people.” </p>
    <p>“Yes,” Ink answers simply. </p>
    <p>Anasatri shifts, stretching one of her wings, “I have a question, about divination. You said earlier that you combined divination with scrying - which sounds <i>terrifying</i> - because you needed to see an exact moment happen. I can cast Divination, but most of what I do is...what I told you before. Intuitive. Visions. And hard to interpret. Do you have a way to see exactly what you need to? If you have a very specific question that you need an answer to?”</p>
    <p>“Hrm…” Ink sits down next to Anasatri, perhaps to help her neck strain. He considers that question for some time before answering, “Figuring out the question… hardest part. Always interpretation. Sometimes have to ask… several different questions. Divination, as a school… not just the spell… never clear cut.” </p>
    <p>“That’s very true,” she sighs. “I <i>can</i> meditate and ask specific yes-or-no questions successfully, but something more complicated than that…” She shakes her head, “I think I have...no, I definitely have at least one question I need to answer, and I even have part of the answer. But I need to know for sure, all parts of it.” She picks at the edge of one of the pillows, “I haven’t had to try to do that before, something that...murky. Any words of wisdom?”</p>
    <p>Ink ponders that for some time before answering.</p>
    <p>“Vaguer the question…” he responds, “Vaguer the answer, but… vague is not always bad.” </p>
    <p>“I <i>have</i> gotten pretty good at interpreting things.” She pauses, “Eventually. Probably, hmm, multiple approaches? <i>Divination</i>, maybe <i>Legend Lore</i>, though that one might be weird. I can <i>Commune</i>, but that’s all the yes-no questions. Oh!” She turns to him with a grin, “We think we almost have the orrery working! A lot of the notes the Lycans left on it suggest it’s an arcane focus of some kind, and <i>my</i> guess is that it’s useful for divination. You’re more than welcome to come study it; Mother knows we could use all the help we can get on that part. Poking unfamiliar magic is, ah, daunting.”</p>
    <p>"Very," Ink agrees, "Would love to see it. Incredible device."</p>
    <p>“I’ll send you a message when it’s done,” she says, tipping over on to her back. “One more question, hopefully simpler, before I take a quick nap.” She gestures upward, “Obviously you’ve done a huge amount of writing. Is there a way to...I don’t know, make it go faster? I’m trying to transcribe my stories, and writing out things I <i>tell</i> is frustrating. There’s not always someone else available and willing to do the transcribing for me.”</p>
    <p>"Know a spell, <i><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scriveners-chant/">Scrivener's Chant</a></i>. Might help, but…" Ink flicks his ears slightly and looks up at the archive, "Prefer to do by hand. <i>Should</i> take time to process. Spell could… let you tell and write at the same time. Focus on story. What you need?" </p>
    <p>“That sounds like it would be a big help.” She gestures, “Takes too long is the wrong wording, I think. It’s...hm, writing is a different format. I tell stories, and they all have a rhythm and a pace, and I can’t write as fast as I tell it, so I lose my place and stumble over it. For some stories that’s fine, but the history stories have to be accurate, down to the word. That’s what I’m looking for. That spell sounds like it could be a big help for making sure the important things are accurate.”</p>
    <p>"Could," Ink nods, "Your ways… different from mine. I… enjoy process. You might need… other process." He seems contemplative.</p>
    <p>"Could… tweak it," he says, "Make storytelling verbal and somatic components." </p>
    <p>Anasatri gives him a happy smile, “That would be wonderful. <i>You’re</i> wonderful” She reaches over to lightly pat his arm before dropping her arm back over her eyes, “I think I need a rest now though, I’ll let you get back to what you were doing and come pester you again later.” She peeks at him out from under her arm, “Thank you though, really. For that and for...all of this.” </p>
    <p>"Thanks…" Ink grumbles, "For… helping us." </p>
    <p>“Anytime,” she murmurs, possibly already half asleep. </p>
    <p>Ink quietly adjusts the pillows for her comfort. He taps the light stone to turn it off and silently leaves her to her rest.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Smilisca yawns and closes the tome he has been perusing. He respectfully shelves it and wanders over to Ink.</p>
    <p>"Mais, it's gettin' late," he tells Ink, "I gotta be gettin' home, me."</p>
    <p>"Sorry," Ink turns to him, "Out of spells. Have place for you to stay, can take you back tomorrow."</p>
    <p>"Issokay," Smilisca waves a hand, "I kin get m'self home, just need to cast a spell without gettin' hit by the goop."</p>
    <p>"Ah…" Ink blinks, "Can… let you through, this time. Will have to ask me to come back."</p>
    <p>"S'fine," Smilisca smiles, "Gonna keep workin' on it, promise weh?"</p>
    <p>"Okay," Ink states. He reaches out and taps Smilisca on the shoulder. He then traces a few sigils on the wall. Shadowy shapes follow his fingers, then evaporate.</p>
    <p>"Ready," Ink notes as he turns back to Smilisca, "And… Thanks." </p>
    <p>"Anytime, cous!" Smilisca states with a smile and a wave. With that, the mud wizard <span class="tooltip">chants a few syllables in Sylvan and disappears with a sort of wet <i>blorp</i> noise<span class="tooltiptext">Teleport</span></span>. He leaves behind a pair wet footprints.</p>
    <p>Ink looks at the wet footprints for a few moments. He makes a little huh noise, then turns back to help the rest of the group with the archive.</p>

    <p id="i" class="center">A note on the Archive:</p>
    <p id="i" class="center">The archive is a powerful tool, but it is far from perfect. As something that could easily derail a campaign, it has limitations.</p>
    <p id="i" class="center">As a rule of thumb, the archive can provide only ideas and hints. It cannot directly solve problems, only provide a starting point for characters to create solutions they might not otherwise be able to come up with.</p>
    <p id="i" class="center">The archive contains knowledge found nowhere else, but all of it has been filtered through Ink and the cryptids, and all of it has been copied and recopied many times. The Cryptids were struggling to survive when it was created, and much of it consists of what they could carry on their backs or what Ink could memorize.</p>
    <p id="i" class="center">It can definitely be wrong, and much of it lacks enough context to be actually useful. Importantly, nothing in it can be proven as absolute fact.</p>
    <p id="i" class="center">That said, the archive puts solutions in play that would be otherwise impossible to achieve. Please consult me for your intended uses for the archive.</p>
