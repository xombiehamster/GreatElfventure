<h1>A Broken Promise</h1>
<p>Breaker is in serious danger. She's currently sitting less than twenty feet from the biggest bomb she's ever seen and trying to hide her intentions from the biggest sociopath she's ever met. Coyote is standing next to her, raising a glass of fine wine in honor of their brave hero Breaker, who fought the fire elf leader one on one in order to secure the prize. The banquet has been going long into the evening, and a few casks have been taken out of the horse. Her heart stops beating every time.</p>
<p><i>When does this damned thing go off?</i></p>
<p><i>You didn't ask, idiot.</i></p>
<p>It's bullshit. It's obviously bullshit. She's long since learned not to listen to Coyote's words, but instead to his tone. Coyote is smug. Self satisfied. Content. He doesn't give a damn about Breaker's victory, so why is he so fucking happy?</p>
<p><i>He knows</i>, a paranoid voice speaks in the back of her head.</p>
<p>She can't hide shit from Coyote, she knows that much. The bastard has a decades long read on her. She had tried to avoid him when she returned, but he had tracked her down. She had tried to keep a straight face when she reported, but his smile just got sharper. He has to know something, has to suspect she's planning to betray him.</p>
<p><i>So why am I not dead?</i></p>
<p>The answer is cold. She had agreed to this stupid banquet to give her most trusted Cazadores time to gather up their civilians and prepare them to flee. Coyote had invited her personally, and she just now realizes some of her most trusted officers are sitting in the front row.</p>
<p><i>Does he know about the bomb?</i></p>
<p>No. He's standing as close to it as she is. No way he would get that close if he didn't know. She realizes what is happening too late. All her most trusted officers and her, all in one place… this is more traditional. Coyote turns to her with a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>She dives sideways on instinct. Hector's falchion crashes through the chair and cuts through her unprotected shoulder. She tries to roll with the blow, but the sheer force of it throws her forward onto the table.</p>
<p>There is a roar of shouting and drawing blades. Coyote is taking the much more traditional route of murdering them all.</p>
<p>Breaker rolls off the table as Hector's falchion cuts it in half. The oil lamps crack and light the tablecloth on fire. All around her, people who trust her are fighting for their lives thanks to her stupidity. Coyote is just leaning back in his chair and sipping wine with a smile. Hector stares at her across the burning table.</p>
<p><i>Fuck it.</i></p>
<p>Breaker darts over to another table and grabs a burning oil lamp. She turns towards Coyote with what she hopes is a madman's grin. His smile falters. Good. She turns towards the Surtian horse. She sees Coyote duck for cover and Hector lunge for her out of the corner of her eye. She hurls the burning lamp at the gift horse's mouth. She dives for what little cover there is as she hears the clay lamp shatter. There is a pop, a crack, and then a rush of heat. </p>
<p>The world erupts in screaming and fire.</p>
