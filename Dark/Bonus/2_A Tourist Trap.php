<h1>A Tourist Trap</h1>

<p>Late in the season, Shyrendora receives a report from a very flustered looking spyhunter. He reports that he was investigating a suspicious guest. A blade elf woman with black hair who signed under an obvious fake name. She rented a common room for three days, and reserved a private bath for a couple hours. He tailed her to the bath because she seemed suspicious, definitely not for any other reason. </p>
<p><i>Anyway</i>, as she entered he saw her dismiss an illusion that was concealing her appearance. In reality she has long white hair and a honking huge sword. It has to be the Tourist. Per Shyrendora's standing order, he immediately pulled back to report to her. He came straight to her and hasn't spoken to a soul. He thinks he wasn't seen and the Tourist has the bath reserved for another hour or two.</p>
<p>If Shyrendora has a clever plan, now's the time.</p>
<p>She has no plan.</p>
<p>Trischal is going to kill her.</p>
<p>Shyrendora makes no effort to keep her approach to the bath silent.  There is no point and her goal is not to catch the Tourist off guard.  She stops at the entrance to the bath out of courtesy and probably a healthy dose of fear.</p>
<p>From the other side of the door, she can hear a strange noise. It sounds like… humming?</p>
<p>Now or never.  She raps her knuckles against the frame of the door.  “Forgive my intrusion of your leisure time, but your arrival here has been brought to my attention and I have...questions.  I only wish for conversation, nothing more.”</p>
<p>The humming continues for a few moments. The song is… cheerful and fast paced. It sounds oddly familiar to Shyrendora. She searches her memory for a few moments and is surprisingly able to place it. It's a tune she has heard played on the river elf flotilla in the evenings.</p>
<p>Before Shyrendora has a chance to process that, the humming stops. There are several seconds of silence.</p>
<p>"Strange," A voice speaks from the other side of the closed door, "I've never had a conversation with a door before."</p>
<p>An eyebrow raises.  “They make for wonderful conversationalists.  Really get their point across one way or another.”  There is a muffled laugh from the other side. She sighs and reins herself in.  “I was not going to barge in.  I do value my life a mite bit more than that and you are a guest.”</p>
<p>"Well, I'm getting tired of talking to the door, so you'd better come in if you're so determined. Just close the door behind you, I don't want to lose any steam."</p>
<p>Being the approximate size of a twig makes the request a simple one.  Barely any steam lost with the opening and closing of the door.  She keeps her hand pressed to the door for a moment then drops it to her side.  "Your fake name could use some work.  Though I suppose saying you are a tourist of sorts is less subtle than what you want."</p>
<p>The Tourist is mercifully in her elven form. She currently sits in the bath, apparently washing her hair. Her sword is within arm’s reach, though it is still in the sheath and has a bundle of her possessions (and her clothes) tied to that. Also within arm’s reach is a bar of soap and small leather case full of what appear to be fine personal hygiene tools made of mithral with gold inlay. She is currently slowly running a fine toothed comb through her hair as she washes it. She is also not looking in Shyrendora’s direction.</p>
<p>“So let’s see,” She speaks idly, “Your feet are quiet enough but you knocked, so you’re probably not an assassin. At least not a good one. You don’t have ten or so guards around you like I expected, so you were apparently being genuinely honest about seeing me as a guest and just wanting to talk. Obviously, you know who I am. So, you knocked and entered a room with someone you <i>know</i> is a powerful werewolf capable of great violence. Alone.”</p>
<p>She turns her head towards Shyrendora, “And you’re making sarcastic comments at her. You must be Shyrendora.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora eyes the sword for a moment.  River elves were not lying about that, good to know.  “So pleased to hear my reputation precedes me.”  She pauses before giving the Tourist her attention again.  “According to stories, you are capable of more than violence.  I heard the tune you were humming.”</p>
<p>"Catchy, isn't it?"</p>
<p>“Very.”  She tilts her head.  “I doubt I will get straight answers, but I am curious as to your motives.”</p>
<p>“My motives?” She snorts, “Do you have <i>any idea</i> how long it’s been since I had a hot bath? Because if you do, please tell me as I have forgotten. And this!”</p>
<p>Moving her hand slowly, she picks up the bar of soap and smells it, “Lavender! And… olive oil? I haven’t bathed with anything other than ditch soap made of campfire ash and deer fat in years. I haven’t seen soap this nice in over a decade. Where did you even <i>get</i> this?”</p>
<p>Despite her efforts not to, a slight chuckle leaves Shyrendora.  "Fair enough, I walked into that one.  Skeletons and Echos have little use for soap."</p>
<p>She leans against the wall by the door and loosely crosses her arms, "How about this then - why bother to wander in an area full of people who are very likely to react poorly to your presence?"  She thinks back. "Supposedly alone."</p>
<p>“I <i>am</i> alone,” The Tourist sinks lower into the bath, resting the back of her head on the edge. She does not speak again for a few moments.</p>
<p>“If you find a place that wouldn’t hate me, let me know. As far as I can tell, there are none left. I know I am hated. It’s… understandable. I know what we did to your people. I deserve as much. As to why I keep walking into things like this…”</p>
<p>She closes her eyes and sighs, “What can I say? I am weak. I am a creature of habit, and a product of civilization. Even if my civilization no longer exists. I… worry that if I don’t keep up the trappings of being a rational animal, the next time that I enter my wolf form I will forget how to return.”</p>
<p>She stays silent for a few moments again before speaking, “You said I am a guest. Knowing what I am. Does that still stand?”</p>
<p>Shyrendora silently absorbs the offered answer.  "You checked in as a guest and have not warranted any reason for that to be revoked.  From what I have seen, you can do great violence but do not seem interested in active harm."</p>
<p>She mutters softly before speaking up once more.  "You are welcome to the days you have paid for.  I will have to see for myself what may or may not come in your wake."</p>
<p>“That is kind,” the Tourist sighs, “For my part, I am here as a guest. Nothing more. I give you my word, such as it is.”</p>
<p>She turns her head slightly towards the dark elf, “But why? You have no reason to trust me. I’ve done nothing to deserve such hospitality. You have nothing to gain other than a few coins, and quite a lot of risk, even if you believe I mean no harm. If the other elves found out you allowed me to stay…” She trails off.</p>
<p>“And why in the world <i>did</i> you come to talk to me alone?” She finishes.</p>
<p>A wiry smile plays across Shyrendora’s face.  "Hospitality and trust are two separate things.  I trust my scouts to let me know if anything untoward happens.  My Uncle has plans for this place as a respite for the weary and I plan to honor that to my greatest capability." </p>
<p>She sighs, leans more heavily against the wall and continues, her voice soft,  "The war is over, and I have had words from a river elf playing in my ears.  Running you out of here may make people feel better, vindicated even, but it does not erase the hurt or the wrongs.  It does not bring back our home.  The best we can do is remember and move forwards to something potentially better than what has been left behind."</p>
<p>“As for why I came alone?”  She moves her fingers as if counting.  “This would have not gone nearly as peacefully if I had brought others, and my goal was to avoid any hostilities.  This general area has seen enough of that to last a few lifetimes.”  Another finger raises then falls back down, “If this had turned hostile, I did not want anyone else to get hurt.”  She sounds tired, “It would not be the first time I gave into folly and tried to take on a task far greater than my capabilities to keep others out of harm.”</p>
<p>The Tourist is silent while Shyrendora speaks. A strange look comes over her face, distant and perhaps lost in thought.</p>
<p>“You are a fool, Shyrendora,” her words are harsh but her tone is soft and her voice quiet, “A brave, kindhearted fool. Why are you still here when so many other brave fools are dead in the dirt?”</p>
<p>Almost as soon as she says that, the Tourist grimaces, “I… I’m sorry. That was a horrifically cruel thing to say. Please forgive me.”</p>
<p>Shyrendora gives off a rather genuine sounding laugh before responding.  “There is nothing to forgive.  I hear those words often enough from much more personal sources.”</p>
<p>She straightens out of her wall lounging position and shifts back to the door.  “My curiosity is sated, I thank you.  I am sure you would like to get back to your bath.  I will see that you have no disturbances outside of what I have already caused.”</p>
<p>A pause.  “Aside from your lacking fake name, is there anything you prefer being referred to as?”</p>
<p>The Tourist chews on her lip for a moment, carefully considering that question.</p>
<p>"If you see the name Katya Vatik on your registry," she says, "Feel free to come and talk to me."</p>
<p>There is a silent tilt of Shyrendora’s head in acknowledgement.  “I will keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>As Shyrendora turns to slip out, the Tourist - Katya? - calls out.</p>
<p>"Shyrendora."</p>
<p>She turns. Maybe-Katya is leaning against the edge of the bath with her arms folded. For the first time in their conversation they make eye contact. There is something deeply unsettling behind the werewolf's blue eyes.</p>
<p>"There are precious few brave kindhearted fools left in the world," She speaks in a level tone, "Never yield."</p>
<p>With that, the Tourist turns back around and resumes cleaning her hair. She even starts humming the tune again.</p>
<p>With nothing more to say, but quite a bit to think about, Shyrendora leaves the Tourist to her grooming.</p>
