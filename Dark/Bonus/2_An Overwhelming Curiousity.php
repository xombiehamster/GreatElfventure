<p><b>An Overwhelming Curiousity</b></p>

<p>Ink arrives to the Hilt’Inn early in the season to enchant the Dark Elves’ feather. He doesn't request much, just a simple room as far away from other guests as possible, and food that meets his raw meat diet requirements. He stays out of the way, not leaving the room often.</p>
<p>Despite this, rumors have been spreading about Ink and his strange abilities. Younger elves have been scrambling to get a look at him, as well as some dark elf leaders.</p>
<p>At this time, Ink appears to take a break from enchanting. His tattoos return to the single emblem on his chest, and he takes a seat in the corner to drink from a mug of water, the only thing he ever seems to drink.</p>
<p>Someone is making noise outside the door to his room.</p>
<p>Amenidal looks about five seconds away from fainting around the corner as Rasputin oh-so-helpfully puts a weird thing of papers in his hand.  “So you go up, give pamphlet and make talky-talk about wonderful spas!  Can take pamphlet home to show others!  Or hang up on wall if no others around.”</p>
<p>Trischal, who was roped into babysitting/making sure no one bothers Ink, eyes Rasputin.  “Remind me again why I am letting you do this?”</p>
<p>Rasputin turns to her with a blinding smile, all teeth and far too big for his thin face.  “Because I am not technically the one doing the talky-talk!”</p>
<p>She squints at him before letting her own curiosity get the better of her.  “Fine.”  They both take up one of Amenidal’s arms and scooch the poor boy out from behind the corner.</p>
<p>Amenidal is wide eyed and squeaks a couple of times before clearing his throat.  “H-Hello!”</p>
<p>Ink sets the mug down and looks at Amenidal.</p>
<p>"Hello." he replies in the same voice he always does.</p>
<p>Amenidal shuffles closer, his eyes flicking from the feather, to Ink, then to the floor and back again.  “Ah...hi, I’m Amenidal.  We...well we didn’t meet-meet, but we met in passing at the potluck.”</p>
<p>He stays a respectable distance back and holds out the weird looking papers.  “Ah...um...Uncle wanted me to give these to you, since you are the first real uhh...diplomatic visitor that we’ve had here.”  He casts a glance over his shoulder where Rasputin’s hand is making encouraging gestures from around the corner.  “We-We have really nice spas, if you have an interest and um...they’re a good place for taking breaks and recharging.”</p>
<p>"I know you," Ink takes the brochures with an arm long enough to do so without standing up.</p>
<p>He looks over them and blinks.</p>
<p>"Spas…?" He seems confused, "I ask for nothing."</p>
<p>He gestures at the feather, "It is for you. I ask for nothing. "</p>
<p>The brochures...don’t really say much.  They look like a blind two-year old took a piece of charcoal and attempted to draw pictures based on third-party descriptions.  A lot of the words are misspelled and wonky.</p>
<p>Amenidal scratches the side of his face.  “It’s...not really that you asked for it?  More of...that we want to thank you for doing it.  A gift for a gift.  Also just a general invitation.”  He gets slightly flustered, “Not that you have to accept it!  Not accepting it is ok.”</p>
<p>His attention goes back to the feather.  Feather is good.  Feather will save him from embarrassment, yes.</p>
<p>"A gift." Ink repeats with flat inflection, "I am welcome?"</p>
<p>Amenidal gives the cryptid a sunny smile.  “Uh-huh!  I’m pretty sure you’re welcome here anytime you want to be, with maybe some forewarning, but still welcome here.”</p>
<p>A mutter of “<small>Thank the Echos he added forewarning, I don’t need five new heart attacks</small>” in Trischal’s voice from out of sight.</p>
<p>The boy sucks in a breath, as if gathering courage, before he points to the feather.  “Can I...can I watch?  Uh, the enchanting process.”</p>
<p>Ink slowly turns his head and stares at Amenidal for several seconds.</p>
<p>“I cannot show you my magic,” Ink finally says, “It would put us in danger. Not because of you.</p>
<p>He pauses.</p>
<p>“I can show you other things.”</p>
<p>Amenidal slumps in defeat, ears drooping slightly for maybe two seconds before they shoot up with a rather intense renewal of curiosity.  “Other things?”</p>
<p>Ink looks at Amenidal, "Let me see your tattoos."</p>
<p>There is a long pause while the gears turn hard in Amenidal's head.  "My tattoos?  Well...I don't have as many as some older dark elves but," he holds up an arm where different size triangles touch and overlap one another in a pattern up the center of the underside of his forearm.  Some thicker lines branch off from the triangles and wrap around the rest of his forearm like a bracelet.  "I'm kinda proud about <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/18/09/26/180926fcffa01e690bb5994aef6459b0.jpg">this one.</a>"</p>
<p>"Hm."</p>
<p>Ink takes the dark elf's forearm in one hand and examines the tattoo carefully. He turns Amenidal's arm gently and traced the lines of the tattoo with a finger. Ink's skin is cool to the touch, but not cold.</p>
<p>"The work is… superb. Who made it?"</p>
<p>The touch has Amenidal's face almost as red as the river elves' spices on their food.  He was not expecting touching.</p>
<p>He squeaks slightly before he clears his throat.  "Um t-thank you.  I uh...I came up with the design and one of our chroniclers from our old home did the work."  His other arm does an uncertain macarena of motions on where to place itself before it goes back to his side.</p>
<p>Ink gives Amenidal a strange look and releases his arm. Ink holds up his own arm parallel with Amenidal's. He taps the symbol on his chest and it unravels. Tattoos quickly spread over Ink's arm, all the way down to his fingertips. They settle and fall still.</p>
<p>They are incredibly intricate geometric designs in repeating fractal patterns. The work is so sublimely detailed that it's hard to tell they are just marks on skin and not a real physical object. The depth, shading, and arrangement make them appear to be three dimensional objects sinking into or rising out of Ink's skin, but looking at them up close Amenidal can tell that this is no magic effect but merely the quality of the art.</p>
<p class="redacted">(For reference, Ink got a 42 on the craft tattoo check for this one.)</p>
<p>"This one is mine."</p>
<p>Amenidal watches Ink tap his tattoo, embarrassment easily giving way to burning curiosity.  Curiosity then fades into awe at the sight of Ink's tattoos.  "Oh wow…"</p>
<p>He touches the held out arm and leans closer to examine the amount of detail.  "These are breathtaking!    Whoever did these is a true artist."</p>
<p>Amenidal looks up with bright, wide eyes.  "Do they mean anything?"</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Ink states, “They do. I cannot tell you. What do yours mean?”</p>
<p>Amenidal purses his lips, obviously biting back some form of question (or five) in favor to mulling over Ink’s question.  </p>
<p>He glances down at his arm before turning it up again for better viewing.  “It’s...kind of a representation of a journey.  A coming of age story, I guess would be another good way of putting it.”  He points to the small black triangle that starts the tattoo on his wrist, “Where I started, who I was.”  He moves his finger up some of the other lines and shapes that overlap, “my trials of figuring out a self to claim as my own.”  Lastly, he lets his finger rest on the bigger triangle by his inner elbow, it is shaded lighter and has a strong black band branching out from it.  “Where I hope to go with the self I have created among my people.” </p>
<p>“<small>Oh they are talking tattoos?  The tall one has tattoos!  I want to see them.</small>”</p>
<p>“<small>Uncle for the love of- you are <i>blind</i>.  You can’t see shit.</small>”</p>
<p>Ink observes quietly while Amenidal explains his tattoos.</p>
<p>“Your chronicler… did they survive?”</p>
<p>“I...I don’t know.”  Amenidal shrugs slightly.  “I think they were a part of a different group when we had to scatter.”</p>
<p>He pauses before shaking his head of the thoughts gathering there.  “Anyway, may I ask if the reason you can’t talk about your tattoos is because they are culturally personal, or -”  His eyes flick ‘down’ to Ink’s chest before going to his face again, “-if it’s Magical-Things-That-Aught-Not-Be-Spoken-Of related?”</p>
<p>The shyness finally creeps back in like a well known, but still unwanted, houseguest.  “Ah!  I mean...you don’t have to say.  I’m just...very curious.”</p>
<p>Ink listens to him very carefully. He looks at his own tattoos for a few moments before answering.</p>
<p>“The most personal reason,” He speaks quietly, “Fear.”</p>
<p>Amenidal stares with his mouth slightly open.  Whether he is shocked because of the answer itself, or because he got an answer at all is uncertain. He processes this for a long while, his head tilting to the side.</p>
<p>“Oh.  Because it’s dangerous.”  It is both a quiet statement and a question rolled into one.</p>
<p>He looks like he is going to reach out and touch Ink again for but a second, before he thinks better of it.  He stares at his hand in thought before leaving it out still.  “Um.  Thank you, for the answer.  I’m sorry for prying, and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”  </p>
<p>Another awkward pause, “Well...no more uncomfortable than you may already be…”</p>
<p>There is a soft scuffle from around the corner.  If either Ink or Amenidal look, they will both see Shyrendora quite firmly dragging a surprised Rasputin and Trischal away from the area.  Her hand is firmly over Rasputin’s mouth from where she has him in what looks like a terribly uncomfortable headlock. </p>
<p>The older elf still manages a weird little wave followed by a very questionable thumbs up.</p>
<p>Ink glances up at the gaggle of questionable elves. He squints suspiciously at Rasputin.</p>
<p>Ink then turns to Amenidal, “You are no bother.”</p>
<p>He contemplates his tattoos for a moment, then his own.</p>
<p>“You have lost much of who you were.”</p>
<p>Amenidal's ears perk up happily at hearing that he is not a bother before settling down into a more neutral position.</p>
<p>He looks over to where Shyrendora is dragging the others away.  "...We have...and it still really hurts but-"</p>
<p>There is determination in his eyes when he turns back to Ink, "-We're going to make it.  We're going to move forward.  I firmly believe that.  The people are strong."  He grins lopsidedly, "It's why the traditionalists are such pains in the ass.  We're all stubborn about what is good for us as a whole."</p>
<p>Ink gives Amenidal an unreadable look.</p>
<p>"I cannot teach the magic," he states, "But I can teach the art. Would you like to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/3rd-party-feats/4-winds-fantasy-gaming/general-feats/master-tattoo-artist/">learn</a>?"</p>
<p>Amenidal's whole body jerks straight, his eyes round like plates.  "Y-" he breaks out into the widest and brightest damn smile ever seen on a dark elf, "Yes please!"  And now he is bouncing. </p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"We will wait until your hands do not shake so much."</p>
<p>With that, Ink goes back to his enchanting work.</p>
<p>Amenidal looks like he’s floating in some distant plane.  “Awesome.  Cool, yeah.  Don’t forget to try the spas sometime.  <small>I’m...going to go lay down.  Yup.</small>”  He wanders away, still bouncing and slightly swaying. </p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
