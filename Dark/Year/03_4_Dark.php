    <p>Now that the infestation of skeletons are mostly gone, clean up the lodge a bit just in case they randomly have to house visitors for one reason or another.  Going to try to update or replace the Old Lodge aspect with something a bit more...inviting?</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p><b>Economic:</b> The dark elves are more than happy to fix up the worn down lodge. After the monumentally difficult engineering projects they’ve taken on this year, it’s almost relaxing. Even the injured and recovering engineers can help. Remodeling interiors, rebuilding exteriors, redecorating, tidying up the outbuildings, removing the knee-high bloodstains, sweeping skeletons into closets, you know just regular stuff. As your engineers and construction teams work on the lodge, they find that unlike most human structures this one was built to last. Strong, sturdy wood beams made up of thick ironwood (the actual wood, not magic ironwood) beams laid out with care. Where it is built into the mountainside, it is well anchored and placed in such a way that rockslides an unstable stone won’t be an issue. It even has flexible jointing so even the long term movements of the caldera are unlikely to cause problems.</p>
    <p>As a final touch, your construction teams gather some of the crystals recovered from the crystal caves and build a chandelier out of volcanic glass in the lobby of the lodge. It’s mostly obsidian, but with green, red, and blue crystals mixed in giving it a quite beautiful complexity in the right light.</p>
    <p>The lodge is ready for guests! Currently, it only has fairly basic accommodations as you’re only able to build so much furniture. The dark elves are able to make at least a few of the larger old rooms that might be suitable for more esteemed guests. Most of your rooms would land on the high side of “common” on the scale of pathfinder’s inn rules, but you’ve got a few “good” quality rooms as well as a few suites on the top floor. With work, you could improve the accommodations or add to them- many of the outbuildings could probably be converted to private cabins.</p>
    <p>In addition, the hot mineral springs just inside the cave entrances have been fixed up and are ready for guests, as well as some of the more relaxing spots along the coast of Crater Lake. So long as people don’t mind catching the occasional skeletal fish.</p>
    <p>Your engineers are impressed at how suitably overengineered the building itself is (very nearly up to dark elf standards!) and your construction teams are able to replace the <i>Old Lodge</i> Aspect with <i>Restored Lodge</i>.</p>
    <p><b>Political:</b>  There were a lot of gaps in your counterintelligence because so much of your population was busy with the wave of horrifying undead monsters, no one really had time to watch the roads coming into the city. If someone wanted to spy on the dark elves, they probably could have just walked up. Your analysts decide to try to learn if there were any breaches during that time.</p>
    <p>Your agents begin interviewing dark elves who were likely to encounter any interlopers in the last year. Just talking, mostly, to those who spent most of their time near the surface to see if anyone noticed anything out of place.</p>
    <p>It seems word of mouth hasn’t reached the outside world about the Hilt’Inn. No one remembers encountering anyone who wasn’t a dark elf, and your group is small enough that you can account for everyone. Even with a disguise, it would be highly unlikely that anyone could have just walked in without someone noticing an elf they didn’t recognize. It seems unlikely you were spied on in the last year.</p>
    <p>Your spyhunters are getting a little more breathing room now, and able to establish protocols and patrols. You will have a <b>boost die</b> on your next cloak and dagger roll.</p>
    <p><b>Military:</b> While you are absolutely flush with eager new recruits, it seems your current group of Sappers really isn’t in a good condition to train newbies this turn. Many of their group are recovering from weeks of exhausting work, some are still recovering from severe injuries, and the command structure is being reorganized after a few senior officers were killed. This is absolutely not anything that they can’t recover from, but it cuts down on the time they have to dedicate towards training new soldiers.</p>
    <p>It’s far from all bad news, though. A number of highly experienced engineers who survived the battles in the tunnels decide to join the Sappers. These engineers fit in well with the current Sappers, and fill out the ranks to replace the losses they had. The Sappers no longer have the Fatigued or Light Casualties conditions.</p>
    <p>In addition, you have a large number of volunteers who meet the standards for Sapper training. They’re still willing to join up, and you will get a <b>boost die</b> if you try again next turn.</p>
    <p><b>Mental:</b> Finally, something that’s normal for the dark elves! Planning a settlement in unusual cave systems is sort of their jam. Building a settlement in the crystal caverns will be difficult, but more than possible. In fact, if you wish to take advantage of those crystals, it’ll be necessary. Some of the crystals are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Cristales_cueva_de_Naica.JPG/1280px-Cristales_cueva_de_Naica.JPG">massive</a> and will take a lot of effort to successfully and safely mine them.</p>
    <p>Actually living among the crystal caverns will definitely be interesting. You’ll have to construct carefully as some of them are razor sharp. The caves go on for literally miles, so there’s definitely room to grow. It’ll also be quite beautiful.</p>
    <p>Due to the successful research performed, you will have an <b>upgrade</b> on your <i>Establishment</i> check to build a settlement in the caverns.</p>
    <p>In addition, your researchers are able to identify one of the strange types of crystal discovered in the cavern. It is a jet black volcanic glass that your researchers assumed was obsidian until they broke several examination tools determining its hardness. Indeed this material is as hard as steel, able to hold an incredibly razor sharp edge, and appears to be resistant to some forms of magic. Working it into usable shapes will be difficult, but with enough raw material it should be possible to make slashing weapons and possibly lamellar style armor from it. Due to its beautiful deep black coloration, your researchers dub it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/EQUIPMENT/SPECIAL-MATERIALS/#Voidglass">voidglass</a>.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>“Home” is just a word. To the dark elves, it is something of a loaded term. To them the word conjures feelings of loss and pain, as well as terrifying memories of being chased through tunnels by vicious killers with jaws as big as a dark elf’s head. Ever since they had to flee their home caves, the dark elves have never felt safe anywhere, much less like they had a home. After the skeleton war, though, things are changing. Hilt’Inn was never meant to be your permanent home, but the Caldera’s caves are finally starting to feel familiar. For the first time in a long time people are starting to speak the word “home” aloud. Even more telling, in the caves beyond Hilt’Inn, the dark elves are beginning to carve their tales into the walls once again. </p>
    <p>You are refugees no more.</p>
    <p>For completing your first turn and forging a new home for the dark elves, you are rewarded with one skill point to distribute wherever you would like. In addition, you receive one refresh point which may at this time be exchanged for a stunt of your choosing.</p>
    <p>Going to go through today and make a tiny list of my added stuff and reread information.</p>
    <ul><li>Due to their heroism and prestigious status, all further attempts to recruit Sappers specifically will have the <b>difficulty reduced by one</b>.</li>
        <li>*In addition, since you were able to settle directly in the abandoned town you have used only a small amount of the building supplies you brought. You may choose to use these supplies on <b>one future Investment or Establishment check to downgrade the difficulty by one</b>.</li>
    </ul>
